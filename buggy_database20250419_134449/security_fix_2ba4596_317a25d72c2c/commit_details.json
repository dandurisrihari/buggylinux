  "body": "If the PER-3 facility is installed, the breaking-event address is to be\nstored in the low core.\n\nThere is no facility bit for PER-3 in stfl(e) and Linux always uses the\nvalue at address 272 no matter if PER-3 is available or not.\nWe can't hide its existence from the guest. All program interrupts\ninjected via the SIE automatically store this information if the PER-3\nfacility is available in the hypervisor. Also the itdb contains the\naddress automatically.\n\nAs there is no switch to turn this mechanism off, let's simply make it\nconsistent and also store the breaking event address in case of manual\nprogram interrupt injection.\n\nReviewed-by: Jens Freimann <jfrei@linux.vnet.ibm.com>\nSigned-off-by: David Hildenbrand <dahi@linux.vnet.ibm.com>\nReviewed-by: Christian Borntraeger <borntraeger@de.ibm.com>\nSigned-off-by: Christian Borntraeger <borntraeger@de.ibm.com>\nAcked-by: Cornelia Huck <cornelia.huck@de.ibm.com>",
