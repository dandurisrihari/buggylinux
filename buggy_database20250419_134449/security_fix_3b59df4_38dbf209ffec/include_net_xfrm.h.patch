    xfrm: Workaround incompatibility of ESN and async crypto
    
    ESN for esp is defined in RFC 4303. This RFC assumes that the
    sequence number counters are always up to date. However,
    this is not true if an async crypto algorithm is employed.
    
    If the sequence number counters are not up to date on sequence
    number check, we may incorrectly update the upper 32 bit of
    the sequence number. This leads to a DOS.
    
    We workaround this by comparing the upper sequence number,
    (used for authentication) with the upper sequence number
    computed after the async processing. We drop the packet
    if these numbers are different.
    
    To do this, we introduce a recheck function that does this
    check in the ESN case.
