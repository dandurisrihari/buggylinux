A leak via that path has not been demonstrated, but we\n  believe it's at least theoretically possible.\n\n  This is the fix for CVE-2019-18660\"\n\n* tag 'powerpc-spectre-rsb' of /home/torvalds/Downloads/powerpc-CVE-2019-18660.bundle:\n  KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Flush link stack on guest exit to host kernel\n  powerpc/book3s64: Fix link stack flush on context switch",
