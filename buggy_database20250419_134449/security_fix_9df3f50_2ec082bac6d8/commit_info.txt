Full commit message:
arm64: avoid redundant PAC stripping in __builtin_return_address()

In old versions of GCC and Clang, __builtin_return_address() did not
strip the PAC. This was not the behaviour we desired, and so we wrapped
this with code to strip the PAC in commit:

  689eae42afd7a916 ("arm64: mask PAC bits of __builtin_return_address")

Since then, both GCC and Clang decided that __builtin_return_address()
*should* strip the PAC, and the existing behaviour was a bug.

GCC was fixed in 11.1.0, with those fixes backported to 10.2.0, 9.4.0,
8.5.0, but not earlier:

  https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=94891

Clang was fixed in 12.0.0, though this was not backported:

  https://reviews.llvm.org/D75044

When using a compiler whose __builtin_return_address() strips the PAC,
our wrapper to strip the PAC is redundant. Similarly, when pointer
authentication is not in use within the kernel pointers will not have a
PAC, and so there's no point stripping those pointers.

To avoid this redundant work, this patch updates the
__builtin_return_address() wrapper to only be used when in-kernel
pointer authentication is configured and the compiler's
__builtin_return_address() does not strip the PAC.

This is a cleanup/optimization, and not a fix that requires backporting.
Stripping a PAC should be an idempotent operation, and so redundantly
stripping the PAC is not harmful.

There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.
