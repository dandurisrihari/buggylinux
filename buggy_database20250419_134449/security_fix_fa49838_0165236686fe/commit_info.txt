Full commit message:
nfsd: add LOCALIO support

Add server support for bypassing NFS for localhost reads, writes, and
commits. This is only useful when both the client and server are
running on the same host.

If nfsd_open_local_fh() fails then the NFS client will both retry and
fallback to normal network-based read, write and commit operations if
localio is no longer supported.

Care is taken to ensure the same NFS security mechanisms are used
(authentication, etc) regardless of whether localio or regular NFS
access is used.  The auth_domain established as part of the traditional
NFS client access to the NFS server is also used for localio.  Store
auth_domain for localio in nfsd_uuid_t and transfer it to the client
if it is local to the server.

Relative to containers, localio gives the client access to the network
namespace the server has.  This is required to allow the client to
access the server's per-namespace nfsd_net struct.

This commit also introduces the use of NFSD's percpu_ref to interlock
nfsd_destroy_serv and nfsd_open_local_fh, to ensure nn->nfsd_serv is
not destroyed while in use by nfsd_open_local_fh and other LOCALIO
client code.

CONFIG_NFS_LOCALIO enables NFS server support for LOCALIO.
