Full commit message:
Merge tag 'kgdb-6.10-rc1' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/danielt/linux

Pull kgdb updates from Daniel Thompson:
 "Nine patches this cycle and they split into just three topics:

   - Adopt coccinelle's recommendation to adopt str_plural()

   - A set of seven patches to refactor kdb_read() to improve both code
     clarity and its discipline with respect to fixed size buffers.

     This isn't just a refactor. Between them these also fix a cursor
     movement redraw problem and two buffer overflows (one latent and
     one real, albeit difficult to tickle).

   - Fix an NMI-safety problem when enqueuing kdb's keyboard reset code

  I wrote eight of the nine patches in this collection so many thanks to
  Doug Anderson for the reviews. The changes that affects
  drivers/tty/serial is acked by Greg KH"
