The reason why we use the verified flag is to avoid\nconstantly reverifying the block.  However, it doesn't take much\noverhead to make sure the magic number of the xattr block is correct,\nand this will avoid potential crashes.\n\nThis addresses CVE-2018-10879.\n\nhttps://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=200001\n\nSigned-off-by: Theodore Ts'o <tytso@mit.edu>\nReviewed-by: Andreas Dilger <adilger@dilger.ca>\nCc: stable@kernel.org",
