    docs: kernel_feat.py: fix potential command injection
    
    The kernel-feat directive passes its argument straight to the shell.
    This is unfortunate and unnecessary.
    
    Let's always use paths relative to $srctree/Documentation/ and use
    subprocess.check_call() instead of subprocess.Popen(shell=True).
    
    This also makes the code shorter.
    
    This is analogous to commit 3231dd586277 ("docs: kernel_abi.py: fix
    command injection") where we did exactly the same thing for
    kernel_abi.py, somehow I completely missed this one.
