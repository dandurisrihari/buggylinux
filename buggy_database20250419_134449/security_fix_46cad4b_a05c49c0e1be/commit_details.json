  "subject": "mac80211: remove direct probe step before authentication",
  "body": "The direct probe step before authentication was done mostly for\ntwo reasons:\n 1) the BSS data could be stale\n 2) the beacon might not have included all IEs\n\nThe concern (1) doesn't really seem to be relevant any more as\nwe time out BSS information after about 30 seconds, and in fact\nthe original patch only did the direct probe if the data was\nolder than the BSS timeout to begin with. This condition got\n(likely inadvertedly) removed later though.\n\nAnalysing this in more detail shows that since we mostly use\ndata from the association response, the only real reason for\nneeding the probe response was that the code validates the WMM\nparameters, and those are optional in beacons. As the previous\npatches removed that behaviour, we can now remove the direct\nprobe step entirely.\n\nSigned-off-by: Johannes Berg <johannes.berg@intel.com>",
