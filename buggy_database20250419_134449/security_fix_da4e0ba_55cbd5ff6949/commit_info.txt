Full commit message:
tty: n_gsm: replace deprecated strncpy with strscpy

strncpy() is deprecated for use on NUL-terminated destination strings
[1] and as such we should prefer more robust and less ambiguous string
interfaces.

We expect nc->if_name to be NUL-terminated based on existing manual
NUL-byte assignments and checks:
|	nc.if_name[IFNAMSIZ-1] = '\0';
...
| 	if (nc->if_name[0] != '\0')

Let's use the new 2-argument strscpy() since it guarantees
NUL-termination on the destination buffer while correctly using the
destination buffers size to bound the operation.
