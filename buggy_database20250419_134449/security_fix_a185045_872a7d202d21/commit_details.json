  "body": "The driver at76c50x-usb is unable to authenticate with an AP since\nkernel 2.6.31 for the following reason: The join command of the firmware\nneeds to be sent with the right bssid before any transmission can start.\nBefore kernel 2.6.31 mac80211 informed its drivers about the changing\nbssid early enough for at76c50x-usb but during the development of 2.6.31\nmac80211's behaviour changed. Now a new bssid is set after the\nassociation.\n\nThis patch changes the tx routine of the driver at76c50x-usb in such a\nway that a new bssid is extracted from an authentication frame and the\njoin command with that bssid is processed.\n\nSigned-off-by: Sebastian Smolorz <sesmo@gmx.net>\nSigned-off-by: John W.
