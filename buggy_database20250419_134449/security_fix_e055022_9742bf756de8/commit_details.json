Instead of\ndoing two distinct string copies with carefully managed offsets and\nlengths, let's use the more robust and self-explanatory scnprintf().\nscnprintf will 1) respect the bounds of @buf, 2) null-terminate @buf, 3)\ndo the concatenation. This allows us to drop the manual NUL-byte assignment.\n\nAlso, since isdigit() is used about a dozen lines after the open-coded\nversion we'll replace it for uniformity's sake.\n\nAll the strcpy() --> strscpy() replacements are trivial as the source\nstrings are literals and much smaller than the destination size. No\nbehavioral change here.\n\nUse the new 2-argument version of strscpy() introduced in Commit\ne6584c3964f2f (\"string: Allow 2-argument strscpy()\").
