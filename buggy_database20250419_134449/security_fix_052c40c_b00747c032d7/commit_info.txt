Full commit message:
[SCSI] qla2xxx: Correct issue where the rport's upcall was not being made after relogin.

A target can LOGO an initiator at any time (i.e. during I/O,
due to a controller hicup, or as a simple authentication
mechanism after an initial CDB command), when this occurs,
the driver attempts to relogin (PLOGI) to the device via the
DPC thread.  Add code to make the appropriate upcall to the
FC transport layer (fc_remote_port_add()) upon successful
completion of the PLOGI.
