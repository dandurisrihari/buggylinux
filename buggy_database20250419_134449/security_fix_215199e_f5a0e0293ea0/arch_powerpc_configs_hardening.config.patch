    hardening: Provide Kconfig fragments for basic options
    
    Inspired by Salvatore Mesoraca's earlier[1] efforts to provide some
    in-tree guidance for kernel hardening Kconfig options, add a new fragment
    named "hardening-basic.config" (along with some arch-specific fragments)
    that enable a basic set of kernel hardening options that have the least
    (or no) performance impact and remove a reasonable set of legacy APIs.
    
    Using this fragment is as simple as running "make hardening.config".
    
    More extreme fragments can be added[2] in the future to cover all the
    recognized hardening options, and more per-architecture files can be
    added too.
    
    For now, document the fragments directly via comments. Perhaps .rst
    documentation can be generated from them in the future (rather than the
    other way around).
