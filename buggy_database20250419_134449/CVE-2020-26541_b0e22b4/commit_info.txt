Merge tag 'keys-cve-2020-26541-v3' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/dhowells/linux-fs

Pull x509 dbx/mokx UEFI support from David Howells:
 "Here's a set of patches from Eric Snowberg[1] that add support for
  EFI_CERT_X509_GUID entries in the dbx and mokx UEFI tables (such
  entries cause matching certificates to be rejected).

  These are currently ignored and only the hash entries are made use of.

  Additionally Eric included his patches to allow such certificates to
  be preloaded.

  These patches deal with CVE-2020-26541.

  To quote Eric:
       'This is the fifth patch series for adding support for
        EFI_CERT_X509_GUID entries [2]. It has been expanded to not only
        include dbx entries but also entries in the mokx. Additionally
        my series to preload these certificate [3] has also been
        included'"
