Full commit message:
x86/jump_label: Use text_poke_early() during early init

There is no apparent reason not to use text_poke_early() during
early-init, since no patching of code that might be on the stack is done
and only a single core is running.

This is required for the next patches that would set a temporary mm for
text poking, and this mm is only initialized after some static-keys are
enabled/disabled.
