Full commit message:
btrfs: allow error injection for btrfs_search_slot and btrfs_cow_block

The following patches are going to address error handling in relocation,
in order to test those patches I need to be able to inject errors in
btrfs_search_slot and btrfs_cow_block, as we call both of these pretty
often in different cases during relocation.
