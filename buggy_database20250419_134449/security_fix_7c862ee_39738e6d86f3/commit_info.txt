Merge patch series "can: slcan: extend supported features (step 2)"

Dario Binacchi <dario.binacchi@amarulasolutions.com> says:

====================

With this series I try to finish the task, started with the series [1],
of completely removing the dependency of the slcan driver from the
userspace slcand/slcan_attach applications.

The series also contains patches that remove the legacy stuff (slcan_devs,
SLCAN_MAGIC, ...) and do some module cleanup.

The series has been created on top of the patches:

can: slcan: convert comments to network style comments
can: slcan: slcan_init() convert printk(LEVEL ...) to pr_level()
can: slcan: fix whitespace issues
can: slcan: convert comparison to NULL into !val
can: slcan: clean up if/else
can: slcan: use scnprintf() as a hardening measure
can: slcan: do not report txerr and rxerr during bus-off
can: slcan: do not sleep with a spin lock held

applied to linux-next.
