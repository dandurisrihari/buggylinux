xfs: propagate bmap updates to rmapbt

When we map, unmap, or convert an extent in a file's data or attr
fork, schedule a respective update in the rmapbt.  Previous versions
of this patch required a 1:1 correspondence between bmap and rmap,
but this is no longer true as we now have ability to make interval
queries against the rmapbt.

We use the deferred operations code to handle redo operations
atomically and deadlock free.  This plumbs in all five rmap actions
(map, unmap, convert extent, alloc, free); we'll use the first three
now for file data, and reflink will want the last two.  We also add
an error injection site to test log recovery.

Finally, we need to fix the bmap shift extent code to adjust the
rmaps correctly.
