Full commit message:
ALSA: hda/tegra: refactor deprecated strncpy

`strncpy` is deprecated for use on NUL-terminated destination strings [1].

A suitable replacement is `strscpy` [2] due to the fact that it
guarantees NUL-termination on its destination buffer argument which is
_not_ the case for `strncpy`!

It should be noted that the current implementation is unlikely to have a
bug because `drv_name` is a string literal with a size of 9 while
`card->driver` has a size of 16. However, it is probably worthwhile to
switch to a more robust and less ambiguous interface.
