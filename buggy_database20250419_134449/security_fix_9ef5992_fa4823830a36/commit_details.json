Before this patch passwords would be treated as\nraw 8-bit data, which made authentication with Unicode passwords impossible\n(at least passwords with characters > 0xFF).\n\nThe previous code would as a side effect accept passwords encoded with\nISO 8859-1, since Unicode < 0x100 basically is ISO 8859-1.  Software which\nrelies on that will no longer support password chars > 0x7F unless it also\nuses iocharset=iso8859-1.  (mount.cifs does not care about the encoding so\nit will work as expected.)\n\nSigned-off-by: Oskar Liljeblad <oskar@osk.mine.nu>\nSigned-off-by: Shirish Pargaonkar <shirishpargaonkar@gmail.com>\nReviewed-by: Pavel Shilovsky <piastry@etersoft.ru>\nTested-by: A <nimbus1_03087@yahoo.com>\nSigned-off-by: Steve French <smfrench@gmail.com>",
