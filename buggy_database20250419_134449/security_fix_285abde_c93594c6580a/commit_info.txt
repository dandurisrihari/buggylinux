Full commit message:
nfsd: remove old fault injection infrastructure

Remove the old nfsd_for_n_state function and move nfsd_find_client
higher up into the file to get rid of forward declaration. Remove
the struct nfsd_fault_inject_op arguments from the operations as
they are no longer needed by any of them.

Finally, remove the old "standard" get and set routines, which
also eliminates the client_mutex from this code.
