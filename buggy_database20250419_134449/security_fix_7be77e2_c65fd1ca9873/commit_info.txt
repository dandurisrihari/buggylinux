Full commit message:
Fix user struct leakage with locked IPC shem segment

When user locks an ipc shmem segmant with SHM_LOCK ctl and the segment is
already locked the shmem_lock() function returns 0.  After this the
subsequent code leaks the existing user struct:

== ipc/shm.c: sys_shmctl() ==
     ...
     err = shmem_lock(shp->shm_file, 1, user);
     if (!err) {
          shp->shm_perm.mode |= SHM_LOCKED;
          shp->mlock_user = user;
     }
     ...
==

Other results of this are:
1. the new shp->mlock_user is not get-ed and will point to freed
   memory when the task dies.
2. the RLIMIT_MEMLOCK is screwed on both user structs.

The exploit looks like this:

==
    id = shmget(...);
    setresuid(uid, 0, 0);
    shmctl(id, SHM_LOCK, NULL);
    setresuid(uid + 1, 0, 0);
    shmctl(id, SHM_LOCK, NULL);
==

My solution is to return 0 to the userspace and do not change the
segment's user.
