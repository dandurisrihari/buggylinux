Full commit message:
mac80211: bail out from prep_connection() if a reconfig is ongoing

If ieee80211_hw_restart() is called during authentication, the
authentication process will continue, causing the driver to be called
in a wrong state.  This ultimately causes an oops in the iwlwifi
driver (at least).

This fixes bugzilla 195299 partly.
