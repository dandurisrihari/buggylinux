Full commit message:
Merge branch 'x86/urgent' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tip/tip

Pull x86 fixes from Peter Anvin:
 "A pile of fixes related to the VDSO, EFI and 32-bit badsys handling.

  It turns out that removing the section headers from the VDSO breaks
  gdb, so this puts back most of them.  A very simple typo broke
  rt_sigreturn on some versions of glibc, with obviously disastrous
  results.  The rest is pretty much fixes for the corresponding fallout.

  The EFI fixes fixes an arithmetic overflow on 32-bit systems and
  quiets some build warnings.

  Finally, when invoking an invalid system call number on x86-32, we
  bypass a bunch of handling, which can make the audit code oops"
