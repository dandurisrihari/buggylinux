This means that the amount of\nlogically addressible x2APICs was reduced to 16 and VCPUs kept\noverwriting themselves in that region, so even the first cluster wasn't\nset up correctly.\n\nThis patch extends x2APIC support back to the logical_map's limit, and\nkeeps the CVE fixed as messages for non-present APICs are dropped.\n\nSigned-off-by: Radim Kr\u010dm\u00e1\u0159 <rkrcmar@redhat.com>\nSigned-off-by: Paolo Bonzini <pbonzini@redhat.com>",
