  "body": "Mitigate A-MSDU injection attacks (CVE-2020-24588) by detecting if the\ndestination address of a subframe equals an RFC1042 (i.e., LLC/SNAP)\nheader, and if so dropping the complete A-MSDU frame. This mitigates\nknown attacks, although new (unknown) aggregation-based attacks may\nremain possible.\n\nThis defense works because in A-MSDU aggregation injection attacks, a\nnormal encrypted Wi-Fi frame is turned into an A-MSDU frame. This means\nthe first 6 bytes of the first A-MSDU subframe correspond to an RFC1042\nheader. In other words, the destination MAC address of the first A-MSDU\nsubframe contains the start of an RFC1042 header during an aggregation\nattack. We can detect this and thereby prevent this specific attack.\nFor details, see Section 7.2 of \"Fragment and Forge: Breaking Wi-Fi\nThrough Frame Aggregation and Fragmentation\".\n\nNote that for kernel 4.9 and above this patch depends on \"mac80211:\nproperly handle A-MSDUs that start with a rfc1042 header\". Otherwise\nthis patch has no impact and attacks will remain possible.\n\nCc: stable@vger.kernel.org\nSigned-off-by: Mathy Vanhoef <Mathy.Vanhoef@kuleuven.be>\nLink: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20210511200110.25d93176ddaf.I9e265b597f2cd23eb44573f35b625947b386a9de@changeid\nSigned-off-by: Johannes Berg <johannes.berg@intel.com>",
