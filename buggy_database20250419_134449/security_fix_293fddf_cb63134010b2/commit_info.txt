====================
Netfilter fixes for net

The following patchset contains Netfilter fixes for your net tree,
they are:

1) Use mod_timer_pending() to avoid reactivating a dead expectation in
   the h323 conntrack helper, from Liping Zhang.

2) Oneliner to fix a type in the register name defined in the nf_tables
   header.

3) Don't try to look further when we find an inactive elements with no
   descendants in the rbtree set implementation, otherwise we crash.

4) Handle valid zero CSeq in the SIP conntrack helper, from
   Christophe Leroy.

5) Don't display a trailing slash in conntrack helper with no classes
   via /proc/net/nf_conntrack_expect, from Liping Zhang.

6) Fix an expectation leak during creation from the nfqueue path, again
   from Liping Zhang.

7) Validate netlink port ID in verdict message from nfqueue, otherwise
   an injection can be possible. Again from Zhang.

8) Reject conntrack tuples with different transport protocol on
   original and reply tuples, also from Zhang.

9) Validate offset and length in nft_exthdr, make sure they are under
   sizeof(u8), from Laura Garcia Liebana.
