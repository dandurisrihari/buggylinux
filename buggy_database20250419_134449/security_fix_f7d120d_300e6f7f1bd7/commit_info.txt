Full commit message:
staging: rtl8723bs: indicate disconnection when disconnecting

The Realtek RTL8723BS only connects successfully at the very first
time, then it always fails attempting to switch to another AP. No
authentication/association observed from the air capture for each
attempt due to the cfg80211 believes the device is still connected.

Fix this by forcing to indicate the disconnection events during
disconnection so the cfg80211_connect can connect to a different
AP without problem.
