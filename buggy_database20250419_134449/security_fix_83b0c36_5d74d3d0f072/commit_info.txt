Full commit message:
arm64: Add KRYO{3,4}XX CPU cores to spectre-v2 safe list

The "silver" KRYO3XX and KRYO4XX CPU cores are not affected by Spectre
variant 2. Add them to spectre_v2 safe list to correct the spurious
ARM_SMCCC_ARCH_WORKAROUND_1 warning and vulnerability status reported
under sysfs.
