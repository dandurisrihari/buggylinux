Normally, it's\nnot a big issue as DPCD or EDID reads won't (hopefully) exceed that\nvalue.\nThe real issue here is the revocation list read during the HDCP\nauthentication process. (problematic use case:\nhttps://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/third_party/kernel/+/chromeos-4.4/drivers/gpu/drm/rockchip/cdn-dp-reg.c#1152)\nThe list can reach 127*5+4 bytes (num devs * 5 bytes per ID/Bksv +\n4 bytes of an additional info).\nIn other words - CTSes with HDCP Repeater won't pass without this\nfix.
