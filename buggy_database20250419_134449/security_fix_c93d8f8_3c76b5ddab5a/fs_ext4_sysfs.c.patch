    ext4: add basic fs-verity support
    
    Add most of fs-verity support to ext4.  fs-verity is a filesystem
    feature that enables transparent integrity protection and authentication
    of read-only files.  It uses a dm-verity like mechanism at the file
    level: a Merkle tree is used to verify any block in the file in
    log(filesize) time.  It is implemented mainly by helper functions in
    fs/verity/.  See Documentation/filesystems/fsverity.rst for the full
    documentation.
    
    This commit adds all of ext4 fs-verity support except for the actual
    data verification, including:
    
    - Adding a filesystem feature flag and an inode flag for fs-verity.
    
    - Implementing the fsverity_operations to support enabling verity on an
      inode and reading/writing the verity metadata.
    
    - Updating ->write_begin(), ->write_end(), and ->writepages() to support
      writing verity metadata pages.
    
    - Calling the fs-verity hooks for ->open(), ->setattr(), and ->ioctl().
    
    ext4 stores the verity metadata (Merkle tree and fsverity_descriptor)
    past the end of the file, starting at the first 64K boundary beyond
    i_size.  This approach works because (a) verity files are readonly, and
    (b) pages fully beyond i_size aren't visible to userspace but can be
    read/written internally by ext4 with only some relatively small changes
    to ext4.  This approach avoids having to depend on the EA_INODE feature
    and on rearchitecturing ext4's xattr support to support paging
    multi-gigabyte xattrs into memory, and to support encrypting xattrs.
    Note that the verity metadata *must* be encrypted when the file is,
    since it contains hashes of the plaintext data.
    
    This patch incorporates work by Theodore Ts'o and Chandan Rajendra.
