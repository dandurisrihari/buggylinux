    Pull f2fs updates from Jaegeuk Kim:
     "In this round, we've made more work into per-file compression support.
    
      For example, F2FS_IOC_GET | SET_COMPRESS_OPTION provides a way to
      change the algorithm or cluster size per file. F2FS_IOC_COMPRESS |
      DECOMPRESS_FILE provides a way to compress and decompress the existing
      normal files manually.
    
      There is also a new mount option, compress_mode=fs|user, which can
      control who compresses the data.
    
      Chao also added a checksum feature with a mount option so that
      we are able to detect any corrupted cluster.
    
      In addition, Daniel contributed casefolding with encryption patch,
      which will be used for Android devices.
    
      Summary:
    
      Enhancements:
       - add ioctls and mount option to manage per-file compression feature
       - support casefolding with encryption
       - support checksum for compressed cluster
       - avoid IO starvation by replacing mutex with rwsem
       - add sysfs, max_io_bytes, to control max bio size
    
      Bug fixes:
       - fix use-after-free issue when compression and fsverity are enabled
       - fix consistency corruption during fault injection test
       - fix data offset for lseek
       - get rid of buffer_head which has 32bits limit in fiemap
       - fix some bugs in multi-partitions support
       - fix nat entry count calculation in shrinker
       - fix some stat information
    
      And, we've refactored some logics and fix minor bugs as well"
