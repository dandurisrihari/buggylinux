Full commit message:
drm/i915/uc: Track patch level versions on reduced version firmware files

When reduced version firmware files were added (matching major
component being the only strict requirement), the minor version was
still tracked and a notification reported if it was older. However,
the patch version should really be tracked as well for the same
reasons. The KMD can work without the change but if the effort has
been taken to release a new firmware with the change then there must
be a valid reason for doing so - important bug fix, security fix, etc.
And in that case it would be good to alert the user if they are
missing out on that new fix.

v2: Use correct patch version number and drop redunant debug print
(review by Daniele / CI results).
