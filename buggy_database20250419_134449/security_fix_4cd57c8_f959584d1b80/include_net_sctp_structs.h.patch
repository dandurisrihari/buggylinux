    [SCTP]: Enable the sending of the AUTH chunk.
    
    SCTP-AUTH, Section 6.2:
    
       Endpoints MUST send all requested chunks authenticated where this has
       been requested by the peer.  The other chunks MAY be sent
       authenticated or not.  If endpoint pair shared keys are used, one of
       them MUST be selected for authentication.
    
       To send chunks in an authenticated way, the sender MUST include these
       chunks after an AUTH chunk.  This means that a sender MUST bundle
       chunks in order to authenticate them.
    
       If the endpoint has no endpoint pair shared key for the peer, it MUST
       use Shared Key Identifier 0 with an empty endpoint pair shared key.
       If there are multiple endpoint shared keys the sender selects one and
       uses the corresponding Shared Key Identifier
