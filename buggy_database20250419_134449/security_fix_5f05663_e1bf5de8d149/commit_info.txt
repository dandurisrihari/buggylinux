Merge tag 'usb-5.9-rc8' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/usb

Pull USB/PHY fixes from Greg KH:
 "Here are some small USB and PHY driver fixes for 5.9-rc8

  The PHY driver fix resolves an issue found by Dan Carpenter for a
  memory leak.

  The USB fixes fall into two groups:

   - usb gadget fix from Bryan that is a fix for a previous security fix
     that showed up in in-the-wild testing

   - usb core driver matching bugfixes. This fixes a bug that has
     plagued the both the usbip driver and syzbot testing tools this -rc
     release cycle. All is now working properly so usbip connections
     will work, and syzbot can get back to fuzzing USB drivers properly.

  All have been in linux-next for a while with no reported issues"
