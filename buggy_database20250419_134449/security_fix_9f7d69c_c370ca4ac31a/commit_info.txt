Full commit message:
fortify: Convert to struct vs member helpers

In preparation for adding support for __builtin_dynamic_object_size(),
wrap each instance of __builtin_object_size(p, N) with either the new
__struct_size(p) as __bos(p, 0), or __member_size(p) as __bos(p, 1).
This will allow us to replace the definitions with __bdos() next.
There are no binary differences from this change.
