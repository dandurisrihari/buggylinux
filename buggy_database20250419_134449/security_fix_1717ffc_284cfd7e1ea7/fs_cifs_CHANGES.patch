    [CIFS] NTLMv2 support part 5
    
    NTLMv2 authentication (stronger authentication than default NTLM) which
    many servers support now works.  There was a problem with the construction
    of the security blob in the older code.  Currently requires
            /proc/fs/cifs/Experimental to be set to 2
    and
            /proc/fs/cifs/SecurityFlags to be set to 0x4004 (to require using
            NTLMv2 instead of default of NTLM)
    
    Next we will check signing to make sure optional NTLMv2 packet signing also
    works.
