Full commit message:
ath10k: wake up queue upon vif creation

Vif's vdev_id is used as queue number. However due
to the tx pausing design in ath10k it was possible
for a new interface to be created with its tx
queue stopped (via ieee80211_stop_queues). This
could in turn leave the interface inoperable until
ath10k_mac_tx_unlock() was called.

This problem only affected multi-vif scenarios when
new interfaces were created some time later after
other interfaces have been running for some time
and had Tx queue full at some point prior.

Possible manifestation of the bug was
authentication timeout for a client vif.
