Full commit message:
Revert "tracing: Add "(fault)" name injection to kernel probes"

This reverts commit 2e9906f84fc7c99388bb7123ade167250d50f1c0.

It was turned out that commit 2e9906f84fc7 ("tracing: Add "(fault)"
name injection to kernel probes") did not work correctly and probe
events still show just '(fault)' (instead of '"(fault)"'). Also,
current '(fault)' is more explicit that it faulted.

This also moves FAULT_STRING macro to trace.h so that synthetic
event can keep using it, and uses it in trace_probe.c too.
