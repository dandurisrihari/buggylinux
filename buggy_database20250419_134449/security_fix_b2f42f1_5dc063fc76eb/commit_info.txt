SUNRPC: Use xdr_stream to encode replies in server-side GSS upcall helpers

This code constructs replies to the decorated NULL procedure calls
that establish GSS contexts. Convert this code path to use struct
xdr_stream to encode such responses.

Done as part of hardening the server-side RPC header encoding path.
