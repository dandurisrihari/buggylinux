Full commit message:
HWPOISON: Add a madvise() injector for soft page offlining

Process based injection is much easier to handle for test programs,
who can first bring a page into a specific state and then test.
So add a new MADV_SOFT_OFFLINE to soft offline a page, similar
to the existing hard offline injector.
