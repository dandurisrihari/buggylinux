    New features:
    
    - Stage-2 isolation for the host kernel when running in protected mode

    - Force W^X hypervisor mappings in nVHE mode
    - ITS save/restore for guests using direct injection with GICv4.1
    - nVHE panics now produce readable backtraces
    - Guest support for PTP using the ptp_kvm driver

    Fixes:
