Merge tag 'kvmarm-5.13' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/kvmarm/kvmarm into HEAD

KVM/arm64 updates for Linux 5.13

New features:

- Stage-2 isolation for the host kernel when running in protected mode
- Guest SVE support when running in nVHE mode
- Force W^X hypervisor mappings in nVHE mode
- ITS save/restore for guests using direct injection with GICv4.1
- nVHE panics now produce readable backtraces
- Guest support for PTP using the ptp_kvm driver
- Performance improvements in the S2 fault handler
- Alexandru is now a reviewer (not really a new feature...)

Fixes:
- Proper emulation of the GICR_TYPER register
- Handle the complete set of relocation in the nVHE EL2 object
- Get rid of the oprofile dependency in the PMU code (and of the
  oprofile body parts at the same time)
- Debug and SPE fixes
- Fix vcpu reset
