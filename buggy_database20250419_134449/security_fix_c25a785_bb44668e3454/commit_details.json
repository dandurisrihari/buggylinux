  "body": "If the provided system call number is equal to __NR_syscalls, the\ncurrent check will pass and a function pointer just after the system\ncall table may be called, since sys_call_table is an array with total\nsize __NR_syscalls.\n\nWhether or not this is a security bug depends on what the compiler puts\nimmediately after the system call table.  It's likely that this won't do\nanything bad because there is an additional NULL check on the syscall\nentry, but if there happens to be a non-NULL value immediately after the\nsystem call table, this may result in local privilege escalation.\n\nSigned-off-by: Dan Rosenberg <drosenberg@vsecurity.com>\nCc: <stable@vger.kernel.org>\nCc: Chen Liqin <liqin.chen@sunplusct.com>\nCc: Lennox Wu <lennox.wu@gmail.com>\nCc: Eugene Teo <eugeneteo@kernel.sg>\nCc: Arnd Bergmann <arnd@arndb.de>\nSigned-off-by: Andrew Morton <akpm@linux-foundation.org>\nSigned-off-by: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org>",
