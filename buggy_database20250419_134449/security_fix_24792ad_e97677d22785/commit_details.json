  "body": "I/O injection gets reduced if it increases the request service times\nof the victim queue beyond a certain threshold.  The threshold, in its\nturn, is computed as a function of the base service time enjoyed by\nthe queue when it undergoes no injection.\n\nAs a consequence, for injection to work properly, the above base value\nhas to be accurate. In this respect, such a value may vary over\ntime. For example, it varies if the size or the spatial locality of\nthe I/O requests in the queue change. It is then important to update\nthis value whenever possible. This commit performs this update.\n\nReported-by: Srivatsa S. Bhat (VMware) <srivatsa@csail.mit.edu>\nTested-by: Srivatsa S.
