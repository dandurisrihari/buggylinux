We don't run into problems because the address\nis still inside the enclosing struct kvm and we never deference or write\nto it, so this isn't a security issue.\n\nThe warning occurs when KVM_MAX_VCPUS=1 because the increment portion of\nthe loop will *always* cause the loop to load an invalid location since\n++idx will always be > 0.\n\nThis patch moves the load so that the check occurs before the load and\nwe don't run into the compiler warning.\n\nSigned-off-by: Neil Brown <neilb@suse.de>\nSigned-off-by: Jeff Mahoney <jeffm@suse.com>\nSigned-off-by: Avi Kivity <avi@redhat.com>",
