  "body": "If the guest sets the GPA of the time_page so that the request to update the\ntime straddles a page then KVM will write onto an incorrect page.  The\nwrite is done byusing kmap atomic to get a pointer to the page for the time\nstructure and then performing a memcpy to that page starting at an offset\nthat the guest controls.  Well behaved guests always provide a 32-byte aligned\naddress, however a malicious guest could use this to corrupt host kernel\nmemory.\n\nTested: Tested against kvmclock unit test.\n\nSigned-off-by: Andrew Honig <ahonig@google.com>\nSigned-off-by: Marcelo Tosatti <mtosatti@redhat.com>",
