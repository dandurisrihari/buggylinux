x86/lib: Revert to _ASM_EXTABLE_UA() for {get,put}_user() fixups

During memory error injection test on kernels >= v6.4, the kernel panics
like below. However, this issue couldn't be reproduced on kernels <= v6.3.

  mce: [Hardware Error]: CPU 296: Machine Check Exception: f Bank 1: bd80000000100134
  mce: [Hardware Error]: RIP 10:<ffffffff821b9776> {__get_user_nocheck_4+0x6/0x20}

  mce: [Hardware Error]: Run the above through 'mcelog --ascii'
  mce: [Hardware Error]: Machine check: Data load in unrecoverable area of kernel
  Kernel panic - not syncing: Fatal local machine check

The MCA code can recover from an in-kernel #MC if the fixup type is
EX_TYPE_UACCESS, explicitly indicating that the kernel is attempting to
access userspace memory. However, if the fixup type is EX_TYPE_DEFAULT
the only thing that is raised for an in-kernel #MC is a panic.

ex_handler_uaccess() would warn if users gave a non-canonical addresses
(with bit 63 clear) to {get, put}_user(), which was unexpected.

Therefore, commit

  b19b74bc99b1 ("x86/mm: Rework address range check in get_user() and put_user()")

replaced _ASM_EXTABLE_UA() with _ASM_EXTABLE() for {get, put}_user()
fixups. However, the new fixup type EX_TYPE_DEFAULT results in a panic.

Commit

  6014bc27561f ("x86-64: make access_ok() independent of LAM")

added the check gp_fault_address_ok() right before the WARN_ONCE() in
ex_handler_uaccess() to not warn about non-canonical user addresses due
to LAM.

With that in place, revert back to _ASM_EXTABLE_UA() for {get,put}_user()
exception fixups in order to be able to handle in-kernel MCEs correctly
again.
