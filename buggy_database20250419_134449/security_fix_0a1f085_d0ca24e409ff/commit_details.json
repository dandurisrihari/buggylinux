  "body": "Originally Toshiba told us that the only way to disable HDCP was to\nset the receiver in repeater mode, that would make the authentication\nfail because of missing software support. It has worked fine with all\nthe sources we and our customers has used, until it was reported\nproblems with Apple MacBook (Retina, 12-inch, Early 2015)\n(https://support.apple.com/kb/SP712?locale=en_US&viewlocale=en_US)\nwith Apple A1612 USB type-C multiport adapter\n(http://www.apple.com/shop/product/MJ1K2AM/A/usb-c-digital-av-multiport-adapter)\n\nFinally Toshiba came up with a hidden bit that is named \"Manual HDCP\nauthentication\". In this patch the original \"repeater mode\" concept is\nremoved, and the new bit is set instead.\n\nWith his patch HDCP is disabled when connected to the Apple MacBook\nand all other sources we have tested so far. The Apple MacBook is\nconstantly trying to authenticate, but fails and continues to transmit\nunencrypted video.\n\nSigned-off-by: Mats Randgaard <matrandg@cisco.com>\nSigned-off-by: Hans Verkuil <hans.verkuil@cisco.com>\nSigned-off-by: Mauro Carvalho Chehab <mchehab@s-opensource.com>",
