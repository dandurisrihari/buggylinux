Full commit message:
[Security] Keys: Fix oops when adding key to non-keyring

This fixes the problem of an oops occuring when a user attempts to add a
key to a non-keyring key [CVE-2006-1522].

The problem is that __keyring_search_one() doesn't check that the
keyring it's been given is actually a keyring.

I've fixed this problem by:

 (1) declaring that caller of __keyring_search_one() must guarantee that
     the keyring is a keyring; and

 (2) making key_create_or_update() check that the keyring is a keyring,
     and return -ENOTDIR if it isn't.

This can be tested by:

	keyctl add user b b `keyctl add user a a @s`
