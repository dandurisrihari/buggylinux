Full commit message:
cfg80211: support an active monitor interface flag

An active monitor interface is one that is used for communication (via
injection). It is expected to ACK incoming unicast packets. This is
useful for running various 802.11 testing utilities that associate to an
AP via injection and manage the state in user space.
