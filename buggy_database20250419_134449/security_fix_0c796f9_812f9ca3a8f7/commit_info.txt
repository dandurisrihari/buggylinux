Full commit message:
drivers/net/tulip/de4x5.c: fix union member name in DE4X5_GET_REG ioctl

This was previously reported as a security issue due to leakage of
uninitialized stack memory.  Jeff Mahoney pointed out that this is
incorrect since the copied data is from a union (rather than a struct).
Therefore, this patch is only under consideration for the sake of
correctness, and is not security relevant.
