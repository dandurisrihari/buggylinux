Full commit message:
lkdtm: Make arch-specific tests always available

I'd like arch-specific tests to XFAIL when on a mismatched architecture
so that we can more easily compare test coverage across all systems.
Lacking kernel configs or CPU features count as a FAIL, not an XFAIL.

Additionally fixes a build failure under 32-bit UML.

Fixes: 6cb6982f42cb ("lkdtm: arm64: test kernel pointer authentication")
