Merge tag 'soc-fixes-6.6-2' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/soc/soc

Pull ARM SoC fixes from Arnd Bergmann:
 "AngeloGioacchino Del Regno is stepping in as co-maintainer for the
  MediaTek SoC platform and starts by sending some dts fixes for the
  mt8195 platform that had been pending for a while.

  On the ixp4xx platform, Krzysztof Halasa steps down as co-maintainer,
  reflecting that Linus Walleij has been handling this on his own for
  the past few years.

  Generic RISC-V kernels are now marked as incompatible with the RZ/Five
  platform that requires custom hacks both for managing its DMA bounce
  buffers and for addressing low virtual memory.

 Finally, there is one bugfix for the AMDTEE firmware driver to prevent
 a use-after-free bug"
