Full commit message:
KVM: Report IRQ injection status to userspace.

IRQ injection status is either -1 (if there was no CPU found
that should except the interrupt because IRQ was masked or
ioapic was misconfigured or ...) or >= 0 in that case the
number indicates to how many CPUs interrupt was injected.
If the value is 0 it means that the interrupt was coalesced
and probably should be reinjected.
