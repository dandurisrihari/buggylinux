Full commit message:
KVM: s390: optimize wakeup for exitless interrupts

For interrupt injection of floating interrupts we queue the interrupt
either in the GISA or in the floating  interrupt list. The first CPU
that looks at these data structures - either in KVM code or hardware
will then deliver that interrupt. To minimize latency we also:
-a: choose a VCPU to deliver that interrupt. We prefer idle CPUs
-b: we wake up the host thread that runs the VCPU
-c: set an I/O intervention bit for that CPU so that it exits guest
    context as soon as the PSW I/O mask is enabled
This will make sure that this CPU will execute the interrupt delivery
code of KVM very soon.

We can now optimize the injection case if we have exitless interrupts.
The wakeup is still necessary in case the target CPU sleeps. We can
avoid the I/O intervention request bit though. Whenever this
intervention request would be handled, the hardware could also directly
inject the interrupt on that CPU, no need to go through the interrupt
injection loop of KVM.
