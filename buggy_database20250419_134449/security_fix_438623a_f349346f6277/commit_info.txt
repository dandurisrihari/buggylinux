Full commit message:
SUNRPC: Add svc_rqst::rq_auth_stat

I'd like to take commit 4532608d71c8 ("SUNRPC: Clean up generic
dispatcher code") even further by using only private local SVC
dispatchers for all kernel RPC services. This change would enable
the removal of the logic that switches between
svc_generic_dispatch() and a service's private dispatcher, and
simplify the invocation of the service's pc_release method
so that humans can visually verify that it is always invoked
properly.

All that will come later.

First, let's provide a better way to return authentication errors
from SVC dispatcher functions. Instead of overloading the dispatch
method's *statp argument, add a field to struct svc_rqst that can
hold an error value.
