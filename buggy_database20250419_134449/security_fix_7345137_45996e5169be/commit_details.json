  "subject": "[PATCH] wireless/atmel: fix Open System authentication process bugs",
  "body": "This patch fixes a number of bugs in the authentication process:\n\n1) When falling back to Shared Key authentication mode from Open System,\na missing 'return' would cause the auth request to be sent, but would\ndrop the card into Management Error state.  When falling back, the\ndriver should also indicate that it is switching to Shared Key mode by\nsetting exclude_unencrypted.\n\n2) Initial authentication modes were apparently wrong in some cases,\ncausing the driver to attempt Shared Key authentication mode when in\nfact the access point didn't support that mode or even had WEP disabled.\nThe driver should set the correct initial authentication mode based on\nwep_is_on and exclude_unencrypted.\n\n3) Authentication response packets from the access point in Open System\nmode were getting ignored because the driver was expecting the sequence\nnumber of a Shared Key mode response.  The patch separates the OS and SK\nmode handling to provide the correct behavior.\n\nSigned-off-by: Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>\nSigned-off-by: John W. Linville <linville@tuxdriver.com>",
