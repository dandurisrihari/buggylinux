Full commit message:
keys: Grant Link permission to possessers of request_key auth keys

Grant Link permission to the possessers of request_key authentication keys,
thereby allowing a daemon that is servicing upcalls to arrange things such
that only the necessary auth key is passed to the actual service program
and not all the daemon's pending auth keys.
