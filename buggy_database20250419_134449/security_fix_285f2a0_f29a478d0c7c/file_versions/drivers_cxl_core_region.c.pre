    cxl/mem: Fix no cxl_nvd during pmem region auto-assembling
    
    When CXL subsystem is auto-assembling a pmem region during cxl
    endpoint port probing, always hit below calltrace.
    
     BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000078
     #PF: supervisor read access in kernel mode
     #PF: error_code(0x0000) - not-present page
     RIP: 0010:cxl_pmem_region_probe+0x22e/0x360 [cxl_pmem]

    The cxl_nvd of the memdev needs to be available during the pmem region
    probe. Currently the cxl_nvd is registered after the endpoint port probe.
    The endpoint probe, in the case of autoassembly of regions, can cause a
    pmem region probe requiring the not yet available cxl_nvd. Adjust the
    sequence so this dependency is met.
    
    This requires adding a port parameter to cxl_find_nvdimm_bridge() that
    can be used to query the ancestor root port. The endpoint port is not
    yet available, but will share a common ancestor with its parent, so
    start the query from there instead.
