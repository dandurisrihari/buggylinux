Subject: block: do not pass disk names as format strings

CVE Identifiers:
- CVE-2013-2851

Full commit message:
block: do not pass disk names as format strings

Disk names may contain arbitrary strings, so they must not be
interpreted as format strings.  It seems that only md allows arbitrary
strings to be used for disk names, but this could allow for a local
memory corruption from uid 0 into ring 0.
