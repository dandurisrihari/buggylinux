  "body": "+ Define the generic netlink family commands and message attributes to\n  communicate with the userspace daemon\n\n+ The register and unregister commands are sent when connecting or\n  disconnecting a tree. The witness registration keeps a pointer to\n  the tcon and has the same lifetime.\n\n+ Each registration has an id allocated by an IDR. This id is sent to the\n  userspace daemon in the register command, and will be included in the\n  notification messages from the userspace daemon to retrieve from the\n  IDR the matching registration.\n\n+ The authentication information is bundled in the register message.\n  If kerberos is used the message just carries a flag.\n\nSigned-off-by: Samuel Cabrero <scabrero@suse.de>\nReviewed-by: Aurelien Aptel <aaptel@suse.com>\nSigned-off-by: Steve French <stfrench@microsoft.com>",
