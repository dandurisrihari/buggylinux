Full commit message:
crypto: cavium/nitrox - refactor deprecated strncpy

`strncpy` is deprecated for use on NUL-terminated destination strings [1].

We know `hw.partname` is supposed to be NUL-terminated by its later use with seq_printf:
| nitrox_debugfs.c +25
|      seq_printf(s, "  Part Name: %s\n", ndev->hw.partname);

Let's prefer a more robust and less ambiguous string interface.

A suitable replacement is `strscpy` [2] due to the fact that it guarantees
NUL-termination on the destination buffer.
