Full commit message:
Merge tag 'for-linus' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/virt/kvm/kvm

Pull KVM fixes from Radim Krčmář:
 "ARM:
   - a fix for a build failure introduced in -rc1 when tracepoints are
     enabled on 32-bit ARM.

   - disable use of stack pointer protection in the hyp code which can
     cause panics.

   - a handful of VGIC fixes.

   - a fix to the init of the redistributors on GICv3 systems that
     prevented boot with kvmtool on GICv3 systems introduced in -rc1.

   - a number of race conditions fixed in our MMU handling code.

   - a fix for the guest being able to program the debug extensions for
     the host on the 32-bit side.

  PPC:
   - fixes for build failures with PR KVM configurations.

   - a fix for a host crash that can occur on POWER9 with radix guests.

  x86:
   - fixes for nested PML and nested EPT.

   - a fix for crashes caused by reserved bits in SSE MXCSR that could
     have been set by userspace.

   - an optimization of halt polling that fixes high CPU overhead.

   - fixes for four reports from Dan Carpenter's static checker.

   - a protection around code that shouldn't have been preemptible.

   - a fix for port IO emulation"
