    Pull power management updates from Rafael Wysocki:
     "These add a new framework for CPU idle time injection, to be used by
      all of the idle injection code in the kernel in the future, fix some
      issues and add a number of relatively small extensions in multiple
      places.
    
      Specifics:
    
       - Add a new framework for CPU idle time injection (Daniel Lezcano).
    
       - Add AVS support to the armada-37xx cpufreq driver (Gregory
         CLEMENT).
    
       - Add support for current CPU frequency reporting to the ACPI CPPC
         cpufreq driver (George Cherian).
    
       - Rework the cooling device registration in the imx6q/thermal driver
         (Bastian Stender).
    
       - Make the pcc-cpufreq driver refuse to work with dynamic scaling
         governors on systems with many CPUs to avoid scalability issues
         with it (Rafael Wysocki).
    
       - Fix the intel_pstate driver to report different maximum CPU
         frequencies on systems where they really are different and to
         ignore the turbo active ratio if hardware-managend P-states (HWP)
         are in use; make it use the match_string() helper (Xie Yisheng,
         Srinivas Pandruvada).
    
       - Fix a minor deferred probe issue in the qcom-kryo cpufreq driver
         (Niklas Cassel).
    
       - Add a tracepoint for the tracking of frequency limits changes (from
         Andriod) to the cpufreq core (Ruchi Kandoi).
    
       - Fix a circular lock dependency between CPU hotplug and sysfs
         locking in the cpufreq core reported by lockdep (Waiman Long).
    
       - Avoid excessive error reports on driver registration failures in
         the ARM cpuidle driver (Sudeep Holla).
    
       - Add a new device links flag to the driver core to make links go
         away automatically on supplier driver removal (Vivek Gautam).
    
       - Eliminate potential race condition between system-wide power
         management transitions and system shutdown (Pingfan Liu).
    
       - Add a quirk to save NVS memory on system suspend for the ASUS 1025C
         laptop (Willy Tarreau).
    
       - Make more systems use suspend-to-idle (instead of ACPI S3) by
         default (Tristian Celestin).
    
       - Get rid of stack VLA usage in the low-level hibernation code on
         64-bit x86 (Kees Cook).
    
       - Fix error handling in the hibernation core and mark an expected
         fall-through switch in it (Chengguang Xu, Gustavo Silva).
    
       - Extend the generic power domains (genpd) framework to support
         attaching a device to a power domain by name (Ulf Hansson).
    
       - Fix device reference counting and user limits initialization in the
         devfreq core (Arvind Yadav, Matthias Kaehlcke).
    
       - Fix a few issues in the rk3399_dmc devfreq driver and improve its
         documentation (Enric Balletbo i Serra, Lin Huang, Nick Milner).
    
       - Drop a redundant error message from the exynos-ppmu devfreq driver
         (Markus Elfring)"
