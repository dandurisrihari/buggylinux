    Merge tag 'kvm-x86-misc-6.14' of https://github.com/kvm-x86/linux into HEAD
    
    KVM x86 misc changes for 6.14:
    
     - Overhaul KVM's CPUID feature infrastructure to track all vCPU capabilities
       instead of just those where KVM needs to manage state and/or explicitly
       enable the feature in hardware.  Along the way, refactor the code to make
       it easier to add features, and to make it more self-documenting how KVM
       is handling each feature.
    
     - Rework KVM's handling of VM-Exits during event vectoring; this plugs holes
       where KVM unintentionally puts the vCPU into infinite loops in some scenarios
       (e.g. if emulation is triggered by the exit), and brings parity between VMX
       and SVM.
    
     - Add pending request and interrupt injection information to the kvm_exit and
       kvm_entry tracepoints respectively.
    
     - Fix a relatively benign flaw where KVM would end up redoing RDPKRU when
       loading guest/host PKRU, due to a refactoring of the kernel helpers that
       didn't account for KVM's pre-checking of the need to do WRPKRU.
