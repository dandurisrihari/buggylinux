Full commit message:
xen/netfront: fix crash when removing device

When removing a netfront device directly after a suspend/resume cycle
it might happen that the queues have not been setup again, causing a
crash during the attempt to stop the queues another time.

Fix that by checking the queues are existing before trying to stop
them.

This is XSA-465 / CVE-2024-53240.
