Full commit message:
firmware: ti_sci: refactor deprecated strncpy

`strncpy` is deprecated for use on NUL-terminated destination strings [1].

We should prefer more robust and less ambiguous string interfaces.

A suitable replacement is `strscpy` [2] due to the fact that it guarantees
NUL-termination on the destination buffer.

It does not seem like `ver->firmware_description` requires NUL-padding
(which is a behavior that strncpy provides) but if it does let's opt for
`strscpy_pad()`.
