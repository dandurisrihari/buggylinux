  "body": "This adds a DSA driver for:\n\nVitesse VSC7385 SparX-G5 5-port Integrated Gigabit Ethernet Switch\nVitesse VSC7388 SparX-G8 8-port Integrated Gigabit Ethernet Switch\nVitesse VSC7395 SparX-G5e 5+1-port Integrated Gigabit Ethernet Switch\nVitesse VSC7398 SparX-G8e 8-port Integrated Gigabit Ethernet Switch\n\nThese switches have a built-in 8051 CPU and can download and execute\nfirmware in this CPU. They can also be configured to use an external\nCPU handling the switch in a memory-mapped manner by connecting to\nthat external CPU's memory bus.\n\nThis driver (currently) only takes control of the switch chip over\nSPI and configures it to route packages around when connected to a\nCPU port. The chip has embedded PHYs and VLAN support so we model it\nusing DSA as a best fit so we can easily add VLAN support and maybe\nlater also exploit the internal frame header to get more direct\ncontrol over the switch.\n\nThe four built-in GPIO lines are exposed using a standard GPIO chip.\n\nSigned-off-by: Linus Walleij <linus.walleij@linaro.org>\nSigned-off-by: David S.
