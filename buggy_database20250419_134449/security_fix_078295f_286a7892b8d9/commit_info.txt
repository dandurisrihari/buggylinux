====================
bpf: Add BPF_J{LT,LE,SLT,SLE} instructions

This set adds BPF_J{LT,LE,SLT,SLE} instructions to the BPF
insn set, interpreter, JIT hardening code and all JITs are
also updated to support the new instructions. Basic idea is
to reduce register pressure by avoiding BPF_J{GT,GE,SGT,SGE}
rewrites. Removing the workaround for the rewrites in LLVM,
this can result in shorter BPF programs, less stack usage
and less verification complexity. First patch provides some
more details on rationale and integration.

Thanks a lot!
