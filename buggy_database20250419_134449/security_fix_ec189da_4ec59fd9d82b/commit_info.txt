Full commit message:
rpmsg: Replace deprecated strncpy with strscpy_pad

strncpy() is deprecated for use on NUL-terminated destination strings
[1] and as such we should prefer more robust and less ambiguous string
interfaces.

We expect chinfo.name to be NUL-terminated based on its use with format
strings:
|       dev_err(&ctrldev->dev, "failed to create %s channel\n", chinfo.name);

Since chinfo is not default initialized, we should NUL-pad the `name`
field so that the behavior is consistent with what strncpy() provides:
|       struct rpmsg_channel_info chinfo;

Considering the above, a suitable replacement is `strscpy_pad` due to
the fact that it guarantees both NUL-termination and NUL-padding on the
destination buffer.
