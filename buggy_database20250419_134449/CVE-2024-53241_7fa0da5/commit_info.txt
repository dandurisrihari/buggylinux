Full commit message:
x86/xen: remove hypercall page

The hypercall page is no longer needed. It can be removed, as from the
Xen perspective it is optional.

But, from Linux's perspective, it removes naked RET instructions that
escape the speculative protections that Call Depth Tracking and/or
Untrain Ret are trying to achieve.

This is part of XSA-466 / CVE-2024-53241.
