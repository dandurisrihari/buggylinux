Full commit message:
media: atomisp: Remove clearing of ISP crop / compose rectangles on file release

There is no need to clear the ISP sink-pad crop and source-pad
compose rectangles  on release of the /dev/video# file.

Both will be reset by atomisp_set_fmt() which is guaranteed to
get called by atomisp_queue_setup() (if not called already)
before another stream starts and thus before these selections
are used again.

Also the file injection support the comment talks about has long
been dropped from the driver.
