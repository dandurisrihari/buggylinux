  "subject": "rbd: avoid dropping extra reference in rbd_free_disk()",
  "body": "I found during some failure injection testing that the call to\nrbd_free_disk() in the error path of rbd_dev_probe_finish() was\ndropping an extra reference to the disk queue.  The problem\noccurred when put_disk tried to drop a reference to the disk's\nqueue.  A call to blk_cleanup_queue() just prior to that will have\nalso dropped a reference to the queue.\n\nThe problem is that the reference dropped by put_disk() is assumed\nto have been taken by add_disk().  Our code has error paths that can\noccur after the disk and its queue are initialized, but before the\ncall to add_disk(), and in those paths we won't have that extra\nreference.\n\nThe fix is easy though.  In rbd_free_disk() we're already checking\nthe disk's GENHD_FL_UP flag.  That flag is an indication that\nadd_disk() has been called, so just call blk_cleanup_queue()\nconditional on that flag being set.\n\nThis resolves:\n    http://tracker.ceph.com/issues/4800\n\nSigned-off-by: Alex Elder <elder@inktank.com>\nReviewed-by: Josh Durgin <josh.durgin@inktank.com>",
