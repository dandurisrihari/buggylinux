Full commit message:
cfg80211: Add support for FILS shared key authentication offload

Enhance nl80211 and cfg80211 connect request and response APIs to
support FILS shared key authentication offload. The new nl80211
attributes can be used to provide additional information to the driver
to establish a FILS connection. Also enhance the set/del PMKSA to allow
support for adding and deleting PMKSA based on FILS cache identifier.

Add a new feature flag that drivers can use to advertize support for
FILS shared key authentication and association in station mode when
using their own SME.
