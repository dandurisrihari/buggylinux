  "body": "PAuth comes it two parts: address authentication, and generic\nauthentication. So far, KVM mandates that both are implemented.\n\nPAuth also comes in three flavours: Q5, Q3, and IMPDEF. Only one\ncan be implemented for any of address and generic authentication.\n\nCrucially, the architecture doesn't mandate that address and generic\nauthentication implement the *same* flavour. This would make\nimplementing ERETAx very difficult for NV, something we are not\nterribly keen on.\n\nSo only allow PAuth support for KVM on systems that are not totally\ninsane. Which is so far 100% of the known HW.\n\nReviewed-by: Oliver Upton <oliver.upton@linux.dev>\nLink: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20240419102935.1935571-4-maz@kernel.org\nSigned-off-by: Marc Zyngier <maz@kernel.org>",
