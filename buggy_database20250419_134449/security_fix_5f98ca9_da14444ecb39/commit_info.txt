Full commit message:
cifs NTLMv2/NTLMSSP Change variable name mac_key to session key to reflect the key it holds

Change name of variable mac_key to session key.
The reason mac_key was changed to session key is, this structure does not
hold message authentication code, it holds the session key (for ntlmv2,
ntlmv1 etc.).  mac is generated as a signature in cifs_calc* functions.
