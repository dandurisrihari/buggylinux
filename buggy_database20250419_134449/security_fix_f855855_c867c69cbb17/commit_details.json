  "body": "With Bluetooth 2.1 and Simple Pairing the requirement is that any new\nconnection needs to be authenticated and that encryption has been\nswitched on before allowing L2CAP to use it. So make sure that all\nthe requirements are fulfilled and otherwise drop the connection with\na minimal disconnect timeout of 10 milliseconds.\n\nThis change only affects Bluetooth 2.1 devices and Simple Pairing\nneeds to be enabled locally and in the remote host stack. The previous\nchanges made sure that these information are discovered before any\nkind of authentication and encryption is triggered.\n\nSigned-off-by: Marcel Holtmann <marcel@holtmann.org>",
