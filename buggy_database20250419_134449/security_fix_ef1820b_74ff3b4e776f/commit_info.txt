Full commit message:
KVM: arm64: GICv4.1: Add direct injection capability to SGI registers

Most of the GICv3 emulation code that deals with SGIs now has to be
aware of the v4.1 capabilities in order to benefit from it.

Add such support, keyed on the interrupt having the hw flag set and
being a SGI.
