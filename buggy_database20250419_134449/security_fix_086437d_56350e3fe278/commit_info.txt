Full commit message:
kallsyms: replace deprecated strncpy with strscpy

strncpy() is deprecated for use on NUL-terminated destination strings
[1] and as such we should prefer more robust and less ambiguous string
interfaces. The goal is to remove its use completely [2].

namebuf is eventually cleaned of any trailing llvm suffixes using
strstr(). This hints that namebuf should be NUL-terminated.

static void cleanup_symbol_name(char *s)
{
	char *res;
	...
	res = strstr(s, ".llvm.");
	...
}

Due to this, use strscpy() over strncpy() as it guarantees
NUL-termination on the destination buffer. Drop the -1 from the length
calculation as it is no longer needed to ensure NUL-termination.
