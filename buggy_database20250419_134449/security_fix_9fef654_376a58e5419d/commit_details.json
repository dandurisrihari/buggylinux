  "body": "The 2016 version of the spec is more generic about when the\nAP should update the power management state of the peer:\nthe AP shall update the state based on any management or\ndata frames. This means that even non-bufferable management\nframes should be looked at to update to maintain the power\nmanagement state of the peer.\n\nThis can avoid problematic cases for example if a station\ndisappears while being asleep and then re-appears. The AP\nwould remember it as in power save, but the Authentication\nframe couldn't be used to set the peer as awake again.\nNote that this issues wasn't really critical since at some\npoint (after the association) we would have removed the\nstation and created another one with all the states cleared.\n\nSigned-off-by: Emmanuel Grumbach <emmanuel.grumbach@intel.com>\nSigned-off-by: Luca Coelho <luciano.coelho@intel.com>\nSigned-off-by: Johannes Berg <johannes.berg@intel.com>",
