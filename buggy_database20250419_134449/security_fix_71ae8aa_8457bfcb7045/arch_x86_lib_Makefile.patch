    lib: introduce arch optimized hash library
    
    We introduce a new hashing library that is meant to be used in
    the contexts where speed is more important than uniformity of the
    hashed values. The hash library leverages architecture specific
    implementation to achieve high performance and fall backs to
    jhash() for the generic case.
    
    On Intel-based x86 architectures, the library can exploit the crc32l
    instruction, part of the Intel SSE4.2 instruction set, if the
    instruction is supported by the processor. This implementation
    is twice as fast as the jhash() implementation on an i7 processor.
    
    Additional architectures, such as Arm64 provide instructions for
    accelerating the computation of CRC, so they could be added as well
    in follow-up work.
