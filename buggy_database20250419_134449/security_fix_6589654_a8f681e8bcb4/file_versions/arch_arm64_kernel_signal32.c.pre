    arm64: fpsimd: Split cpu field out from struct fpsimd_state
    
    In preparation for using a common representation of the FPSIMD
    state for tasks and KVM vcpus, this patch separates out the "cpu"
    field that is used to track the cpu on which the state was most
    recently loaded.
    
    This will allow common code to operate on task and vcpu contexts
    without requiring the cpu field to be stored at the same offset
    from the FPSIMD register data in both cases.  This should avoid the
    need for messing with the definition of those parts of struct
    vcpu_arch that are exposed in the KVM user ABI.
    
    The resulting change is also convenient for grouping and defining
    the set of thread_struct fields that are supposed to be accessible
    to copy_{to,from}_user(), which includes user_fpsimd_state but
    should exclude the cpu field.  This patch does not amend the
    usercopy whitelist to match: that will be addressed in a subsequent
    patch.
