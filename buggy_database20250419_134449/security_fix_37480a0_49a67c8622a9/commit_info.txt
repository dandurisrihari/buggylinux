Full commit message:
tty: Prevent untrappable signals from malicious program

Commit 26df6d13406d1a5 ("tty: Add EXTPROC support for LINEMODE")
allows a process which has opened a pty master to send _any_ signal
to the process group of the pty slave. Although potentially
exploitable by a malicious program running a setuid program on
a pty slave, it's unknown if this exploit currently exists.

Limit to signals actually used.
