    wifi: iwlwifi: add iwlmld sub-driver
    
    iwlwifi is the driver of all Intel wifi devices since 2008.
    Since then, the hardware has changed a lot, but the firmware
    API has changed even more. The need to keep one driver that
    supports all those different APIs led us to introduce a new
    architecture circa 2012 which allowed us to keep the same
    interface to the hardware (DMAs, Tx queues, etc...) with a
    new layer to implement the mid-layer between mac80211 and
    the firmware. The first component is called the 'transport'
    and the latter is called 'operation_mode' a.k.a  op_mode.
    
    In 2013 we took advantage of the new architecture to
    introduce iwlmvm which allowed us to implement the, then,
    new firmware API. This op_mode supports 7260 and up, those
    devices supports support at least VHT.
    
    Since then, wifi evolved and so did the firmware. It became
    much bigger and took a lot of functionality from the driver.
    It became increasingly hard to keep the same op_mode for the
    newest devices and we experienced frequent regressions on
    older devices. In order to avoid those regressions and keep
    the code maintainable, we decided it was about time to start
    a new op_mode.
    
    iwlmld is a new op_mode that supports BE200 or newer if the
    firmware being used is 97.ucode or newer. If the user has
    an older devices or BE200 with .96.ucode, iwlmvm will be
    loaded. Of course, this op_mode selection is seamless.
    
    All the features supported in iwlmvm are supported in
    iwlmld besides a few seldom used use cases: injection and
    Hotspot 2.0. Those are under work.
    
    A few points about the implementation:
     * iwlmld doesn't have any mutexes, it relies on the
       wiphy_lock
     * iwlmld is more "resource oriented": stations, links and
       interfaces are allocated and freed only after all the
       relevant flows are completed.
     * Firmware notifications' sizes are validated in a more
       structured way.
    
    We would love to see this new op_mode merged in 6.15. The
    firmware for this new driver (.97.ucode) is not yet publicly
    available but it'll be sent very soon.
    People eager to get an early version of this firmware can

    I've listed the people who directly contributed
    code, but many others from various teams have
    contributed in other ways.
