Full commit message:
ACPI, EINJ: Enhance error injection tolerance level

Some BIOSes utilize PCI MMCFG space read/write opertion to trigger
specific errors. EINJ will report errors as below when hitting such
cases:

APEI: Can not request [mem 0x83f990a0-0x83f990a3] for APEI EINJ Trigger registers

It is because on x86 platform ACPI based PCI MMCFG logic has
reserved all MMCFG spaces so that EINJ can't reserve it again.
We already trust the ACPI/APEI code when using the EINJ interface
so it is not a big leap to also trust it to access the right
MMCFG addresses. Skip address checking to allow the access.
