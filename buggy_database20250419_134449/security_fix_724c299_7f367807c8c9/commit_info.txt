Full commit message:
perf/hw_breakpoint: Add KUnit test for constraints accounting

Add KUnit test for hw_breakpoint constraints accounting, with various
interesting mixes of breakpoint targets (some care was taken to catch
interesting corner cases via bug-injection).

The test cannot be built as a module because it requires access to
hw_breakpoint_slots(), which is not inlinable or exported on all
architectures.
