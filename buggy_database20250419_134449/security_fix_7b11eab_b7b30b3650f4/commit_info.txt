Full commit message:
blk-mq: blk-mq: provide forced completion method

Drivers may need to bypass error injection for error recovery. Rename
__blk_mq_complete_request() to blk_mq_force_complete_rq() and export
that function so drivers may skip potential fake timeouts after they've
reclaimed lost requests.
