  "body": "Similar to commit 49b20dbf7497 (\"drm/i915/gt: Perform an arbitration\ncheck before busywaiting\"), also add a check prior to the busywait\non gen8+, as we have now seen (because we added a selftest to add fault\ninjection into the engine resets) the same engine reset failure leading\nto an indefinite wait on the ring-stop semaphore. So not a Tigerlake\nspecific bug after all, though it still seems odd behaviour for the\nbusywait as we do get the arbitration point elsewhere on a miss.\n\nTestcase: igt_reset_fail_engine\nSigned-off-by: Chris Wilson <chris@chris-wilson.co.uk>\nCc: Tvrtko Ursulin <tvrtko.ursulin@intel.com>\nReviewed-by: Tvrtko Ursulin <tvrtko.ursulin@intel.com>\nLink: https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/msgid/20210117110418.3361-1-chris@chris-wilson.co.uk",
