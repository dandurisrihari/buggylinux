Subject: CAN: Use inode instead of kernel address for /proc file

CVE Identifiers:
- CVE-2010-4565

Full commit message:
CAN: Use inode instead of kernel address for /proc file

Since the socket address is just being used as a unique identifier, its
inode number is an alternative that does not leak potentially sensitive
information.

CC-ing stable because MITRE has assigned CVE-2010-4565 to the issue.
