Full commit message:
dt-bindings: remoteproc: qcom,msm8996-mss-pil: Update memory region

The dynamic memory region used for metadata authentication would still
be a part of the kernel mapping and any access to this region by the
application processor after assigning it to the remote Q6 will result
in a XPU violation. This is fixed by using a no-map carveout instead.
Update the bindings to reflect the addition of the new modem metadata
carveout on MSM8996 (and similar) SoCs.
