Merge tag 'x86-urgent-2020-04-12' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tip/tip

Pull x86 fixes from Thomas Gleixner:
 "A set of three patches to fix the fallout of the newly added split
  lock detection feature.

  It addressed the case where a KVM guest triggers a split lock #AC and
  KVM reinjects it into the guest which is not prepared to handle it.

  Add proper sanity checks which prevent the unconditional injection
  into the guest and handles the #AC on the host side in the same way as
  user space detections are handled. Depending on the detection mode it
  either warns and disables detection for the task or kills the task if
  the mode is set to fatal"
