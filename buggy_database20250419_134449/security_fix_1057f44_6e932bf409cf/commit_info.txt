Full commit message:
scsi: elx: libefc: Replace deprecated strncpy() with strscpy_pad()/memcpy()

strncpy() is deprecated for use on NUL-terminated destination strings [1]
and as such we should prefer more robust and less ambiguous string
interfaces.

To keep node->current_state_name and node->prev_state_name NUL-padded and
NUL-terminated let's use strscpy_pad() as this implicitly provides both.

For the swap between the two, a simple memcpy() will suffice.
