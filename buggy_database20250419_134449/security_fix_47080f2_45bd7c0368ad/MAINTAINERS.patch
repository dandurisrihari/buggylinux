    Merge tag 'hwmon-for-v5.13' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/groeck/linux-staging
    
    Pull hwmon updates from Guenter Roeck:
     "The most notable change is the removal of the amd_energy driver. It
      was rendered all but unusable by making its attributes privileged-only
      to work around a security issue. A suggested remedy was rejected by
      AMD, so the only real solution was to remove the driver. For the
      future, we'll have to make sure that no privileged-access-only drivers
      are accepted into the hwmon subsystem in the first place. The hwmon
      ABI document was updated accordingly.
    
      Other changes:
    
      PMBus drivers:
       - Added driver for MAX15301
       - Added driver for BluTek BPA-RS600
       - Added driver for fsp-3y PSUs and PDUs
       - Added driver for Infineon IR36021
       - Added driver for ST STPDDC60
       - Added support for TI TPS53676 to tps53679 driver
       - Introduced PMBUS symbol namespace. This was made necessary by a
         suggestion to use its exported functions from outside the hwmon
         subsystem.
       - Minor improvements and bug fixes
    
      New drivers:
       - Driver for NZXT Kraken X42/X52/X62/X72
    
      Driver enhancements:
       - Added support for Intel D5005 to intel-m10-bmc-hwmon driver
       - Added support for NCT6686D to nct6683 driver
    
      Other:
       - Converted sch5627 and amd9240 drivers to
         hwmon_device_register_with_info()
       - Added support for fan drawers capability and present registers to
         mlxreg-fan driver
       - Added Dell Latitude E7440 to fan control whitelist in dell-smm
         driver
       - Replaced snprintf in show functions with sysfs_emit. Done with
         coccinelle script for all drivers to preempt endless per-driver
         submissions of the same change.
       - Use kobj_to_dev().  Another coccinelle based change to preempt
         endless per-driver submissions of the same change.
       - Various minor fixes and improvements"
