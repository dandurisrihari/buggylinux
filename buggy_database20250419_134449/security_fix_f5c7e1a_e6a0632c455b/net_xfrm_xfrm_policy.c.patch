    ====================
    pull request (net-next): ipsec-next 2014-09-25
    
    1) Remove useless hash_resize_mutex in xfrm_hash_resize().
       This mutex is used only there, but xfrm_hash_resize()
       can't be called concurrently at all. From Ying Xue.
    
    2) Extend policy hashing to prefixed policies based on
       prefix lenght thresholds. From Christophe Gouault.
    
    3) Make the policy hash table thresholds configurable
       via netlink. From Christophe Gouault.
    
    4) Remove the maximum authentication length for AH.
       This was needed to limit stack usage. We switched
       already to allocate space, so no need to keep the
       limit. From Herbert Xu.
