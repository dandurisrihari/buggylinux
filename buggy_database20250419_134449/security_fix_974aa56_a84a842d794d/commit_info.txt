Merge tag 'kvm-4.15-1' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/virt/kvm/kvm

Pull KVM updates from Radim Krčmář:
 "First batch of KVM changes for 4.15

  Common:
   - Python 3 support in kvm_stat
   - Accounting of slabs to kmemcg

  ARM:
   - Optimized arch timer handling for KVM/ARM
   - Improvements to the VGIC ITS code and introduction of an ITS reset
     ioctl
   - Unification of the 32-bit fault injection logic
   - More exact external abort matching logic

  PPC:
   - Support for running hashed page table (HPT) MMU mode on a host that
     is using the radix MMU mode; single threaded mode on POWER 9 is
     added as a pre-requisite
   - Resolution of merge conflicts with the last second 4.14 HPT fixes
   - Fixes and cleanups

  s390:
   - Some initial preparation patches for exitless interrupts and crypto
   - New capability for AIS migration
   - Fixes

  x86:
   - Improved emulation of LAPIC timer mode changes, MCi_STATUS MSRs,
     and after-reset state
   - Refined dependencies for VMX features
   - Fixes for nested SMI injection
   - A lot of cleanups"
