Full commit message:
scsi: csiostor: Replace deprecated strncpy() with strscpy()

strncpy() is deprecated for use on NUL-terminated destination strings [1]
and as such we should prefer more robust and less ambiguous string
interfaces.

'hw' is kzalloc'd just before this string assignment:
|       hw = kzalloc(sizeof(struct csio_hw), GFP_KERNEL);

... which means any NUL-padding is redundant.

Since CSIO_DRV_VERSION is a small string literal (smaller than
sizeof(dest)):

... there is functionally no change in this swap from strncpy() to
strscpy(). Nonetheless, let's make the change for robustness' sake -- as
it will ensure that drv_version is _always_ NUL-terminated.
