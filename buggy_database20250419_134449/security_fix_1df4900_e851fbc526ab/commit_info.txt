[PATCH] fault injection: split up stacktrace filter Kconfig option

There is no prompt for CONFIG_STACKTRACE, so FAULT_INJECTION cannot be
selected without LOCKDEP enabled.  (found by Paolo 'Blaisorblade'
Giarrusso)

In order to fix such broken Kconfig dependency, this patch splits up the
stacktrace filter support for fault injection by new Kconfig option, which
enables to use fault injection on the architecture which doesn't have
general stacktrace support.
