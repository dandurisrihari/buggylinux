Full commit message:
erofs: fix out-of-bound access when z_erofs_gbuf_growsize() partially fails

If z_erofs_gbuf_growsize() partially fails on a global buffer due to
memory allocation failure or fault injection (as reported by syzbot [1]),
new pages need to be freed by comparing to the existing pages to avoid
memory leaks.

However, the old gbuf->pages[] array may not be large enough, which can
lead to null-ptr-deref or out-of-bound access.

Fix this by checking against gbuf->nrpages in advance.
