Full commit message:
s390/qeth: don't clobber buffer on async TX completion

If qeth_qdio_output_handler() detects that a transmit requires async
completion, it replaces the pending buffer's metadata object
(qeth_qdio_out_buffer) so that this queue buffer can be re-used while
the data is pending completion.

Later when the CQ indicates async completion of such a metadata object,
qeth_qdio_cq_handler() tries to free any data associated with this
object (since HW has now completed the transfer). By calling
qeth_clear_output_buffer(), it erronously operates on the queue buffer
that _previously_ belonged to this transfer ... but which has been
potentially re-used several times by now.
This results in double-free's of the buffer's data, and failing
transmits as the buffer descriptor is scrubbed in mid-air.

The correct way of handling this situation is to
1. scrub the queue buffer when it is prepared for re-use, and
2. later obtain the data addresses from the async-completion notifier
   (ie. the AOB), instead of the queue buffer.

All this only affects qeth devices used for af_iucv HiperTransport.
