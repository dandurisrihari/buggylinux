This pull request contains a NULL dereference fix,\nand some security/pairing fixes.\"\n\nFor the iwlwifi bits, Emmanuel says:\n\n\"I have here a fix from Eliad for scheduled scan: it fixes a firmware\nassertion. Arik reverts a patch I made that didn't take into account\nthat 3160 doesn't have UAPSD and hence, we can't assume that all\nnewer firmwares support the feature. Here too, the visible effect\nis a firmware assertion. Along with that, we have a few fixes and\nadditions to the device list.\"\n\nFor the ath10k bits, Kalle says:\n\n\"Bartosz fixed an issue where we were not able to create 8 vdevs when\nusing DFS. Michal removed a false warning which was just confusing\npeople.\"\n\nOn top of that...\n\nArend van Spriel fixes a 'divide by zero' regression in brcmfmac.\n\nAmitkumar Karwar corrects a transmit timeout in mwifiex.\n====================\n\nSigned-off-by: David S.
