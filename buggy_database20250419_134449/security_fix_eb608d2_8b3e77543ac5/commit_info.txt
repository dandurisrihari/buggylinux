====================
pull request: wireless 2014-06-27

Please pull the following batch of fixes for the 3.16 stream...

For the mac80211 bits, Johannes says:

"We have a fix from Eliad for a time calculation, a fix from Max for
head/tailroom when sending authentication packets, a revert that Felix
requested since the patch in question broke regulatory and a fix from
myself for an issue with a new command that we advertised in the wrong
place."

For the bluetooth bits, Gustavo says:

"A few fixes for 3.16. This pull request contains a NULL dereference fix,
and some security/pairing fixes."

For the iwlwifi bits, Emmanuel says:

"I have here a fix from Eliad for scheduled scan: it fixes a firmware
assertion. Arik reverts a patch I made that didn't take into account
that 3160 doesn't have UAPSD and hence, we can't assume that all
newer firmwares support the feature. Here too, the visible effect
is a firmware assertion. Along with that, we have a few fixes and
additions to the device list."

For the ath10k bits, Kalle says:

"Bartosz fixed an issue where we were not able to create 8 vdevs when
using DFS. Michal removed a false warning which was just confusing
people."

On top of that...

Arend van Spriel fixes a 'divide by zero' regression in brcmfmac.

Amitkumar Karwar corrects a transmit timeout in mwifiex.
