Full commit message:
gcc-plugins: randstruct: Remove cast exception handling

With all randstruct exceptions removed, remove all the exception
handling code. Any future warnings are likely to be shared between
this plugin and Clang randstruct, and will need to be addressed in a
more wholistic fashion.
