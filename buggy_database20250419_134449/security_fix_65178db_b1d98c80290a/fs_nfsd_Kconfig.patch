    NFSD: Added fault injection
    
    Fault injection on the NFS server makes it easier to test the client's
    state manager and recovery threads.  Simulating errors on the server is
    easier than finding the right conditions that cause them naturally.
    
    This patch uses debugfs to add a simple framework for fault injection to
    the server.  This framework is a config option, and can be enabled
    through CONFIG_NFSD_FAULT_INJECTION.  Assuming you have debugfs mounted
    to /sys/debug, a set of files will be created in /sys/debug/nfsd/.
    Writing to any of these files will cause the corresponding action and
    write a log entry to dmesg.
