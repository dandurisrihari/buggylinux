Full commit message:
HID: uhid: replace deprecated strncpy with strscpy

`strncpy` is deprecated for use on NUL-terminated destination strings
[1] and as such we should prefer more robust and less ambiguous string
interfaces.

A suitable replacement is `strscpy` [2] due to the fact that it
guarantees NUL-termination on the destination buffer without
unnecessarily NUL-padding.

Furthermore, let's make sure `hid->xyz` and `ev->u.create2.xyz` are the
same size at compile time to prevent silent truncation.

With these changes, it is abundantly clear what the intent and behavior
of the code is -- We are getting a string to string copy with
NUL-termination and no truncation.
