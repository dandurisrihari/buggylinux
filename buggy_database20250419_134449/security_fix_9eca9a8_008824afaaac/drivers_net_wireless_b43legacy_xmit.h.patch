    b43legacy: drop packets we are not able to encrypt
    
    We must drop any packets we are not able to encrypt.
    We must not send them unencrypted or with an all-zero-key (which
    basically is the same as unencrypted, from a security point of view).
    
    This might only trigger shortly after resume before mac80211 reassociated
    and reconfigured the keys.
    
    It is safe to drop these packets, as the association they belong to
    is not guaranteed anymore anyway.
    This is a security fix in the sense that it prevents information leakage.
    
    This patch by Michael Buesch has been ported to b43legacy.
