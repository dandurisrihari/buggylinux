Full commit message:
power: supply: bq256xx: replace deprecated strncpy with strscpy

strncpy() is deprecated for use on NUL-terminated destination strings
[1] and as such we should prefer more robust and less ambiguous string
interfaces.

We expect bq->model_name to be NUL-terminated based on its usage with
sysfs_emit and format strings:

val->strval is assigned to bq->model_name in
bq256xx_get_charger_property():
|       val->strval = bq->model_name;

... then in power_supply_sysfs.c we use value.strval with a format string:
|       ret = sysfs_emit(buf, "%s\n", value.strval);

we assigned value.strval via:
|       ret = power_supply_get_property(psy, psp, &value);
... which invokes psy->desc->get_property():
|       return psy->desc->get_property(psy, psp, val);

with bq256xx_get_charger_property():
|       static const struct power_supply_desc bq256xx_power_supply_desc = {
...
|       	.get_property = bq256xx_get_charger_property,

Moreover, no NUL-padding is required as bq is zero-allocated in
bq256xx_charger.c:
|       bq = devm_kzalloc(dev, sizeof(*bq), GFP_KERNEL);

Considering the above, a suitable replacement is `strscpy` [2] due to
the fact that it guarantees NUL-termination on the destination buffer
without unnecessarily NUL-padding.

Let's also opt to use the more idiomatic strscpy() usage of (dest, src,
sizeof(dest)) as this more closely ties the destination buffer and the
length.
