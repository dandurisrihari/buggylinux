Full commit message:
thunderbolt: Add support for authenticate on disconnect

Some external devices can support completing thunderbolt authentication
when they are unplugged. For this to work though, the link controller must
remain operational.

The only device known to support this right now is the Dell WD19TB, so add
a quirk for this.
