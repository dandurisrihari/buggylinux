    thunderbolt: Add support for separating the flush to SPI and authenticate
    
    This allows userspace to have a shorter period of time that the device
    is unusable and to call it at a more convenient time.
    
    For example flushing the image may happen while the user is using the
    machine and authenticating/rebooting may happen while logging out.
