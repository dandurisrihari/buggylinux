Of course, I'm sure there will be a few stragglers here\nand there...surely a few bug fixes as well... :-) (In fact, I see\nthat Johannes has already queued-up a few more for me while I was\npreparing this...)\n\nIncluded are a number of pulls...\n\nFor mac80211-next, Johannes says:\n\n\"The biggest change I have is undoubtedly Marco's mesh powersave\nimplementation. Beyond that, I have a patch from Emmanuel to modify the\nDTIM period API in mac80211, scan improvements and a removal of some\nprevious workaround code from Stanislaw, dynamic short slot time from\nThomas and 64-bit station byte counters from Vladimir. I also made a\nnumber of changes myself, some related to WoWLAN, some auth/deauth\nimprovements and most of them BSS list cleanups.\"\n\n\"This time, I have relatively large number of fixes in various areas of\nthe code (a memory leak in regulatory, an RX race in mac80211, the new\nradar checking caused a P2P device problem, some mesh issues with\nstations, an older bug in tracing and for kernel-doc) as well as a\nnumber of small new features. The biggest (in the diffstat) is my work\non hidden SSID tracking.\"\n\n\"Please pull to get\n * radar detection work from Simon\n * mesh improvements from Thomas\n * a connection monitoring/powersave fix from Wojciech\n * TDLS-related station management work from Jouni\n * VLAN crypto fixes from Michael Braun\n * CCK support in minstrel_ht from Felix\n * an SMPS (not SMSP, oops) related improvement in mac80211 (Emmanuel)\n * some WoWLAN work from Amitkumar Karwar: pattern match offset and a\n   documentation fix\n * some WoWLAN work from myself (TCP connection wakeup feature API)\n * and a lot of VHT (and some HT) work (also from myself)\n\nAnd a number of more random cleanups/fixes. I merged mac80211/master to\navoid a merge problem there.\"\n\nAnd regarding iwlwifi-next, Johannes says:\n\n\"We continue work on our new driver, but I also have a WoWLAN and AP mode\nimprovement for the previous driver and a change to use threaded\ninterrupts to prepare us for working with non-PCIe devices.\"\n\nRegarding wl12xx, Luca says:\n\n\"A few more patches intended for 3.9.  Mostly some clean-ups I've been\ndoing to make it easier to support device-tree.  Also including one bug\nfix for wl12xx where the rates we advertise were wrong and an update in\nthe wlconf structure to support newer firmwares.\"\n\nFor the nfc-next bits, Samuel says:\n\n\"This is the second NFC pull request for 3.9.\n\nWe have:\n\n- A few pn533 fixes on top of Waldemar refactorization of the driver, one of\n  them fixes target mode.\n\n- A new driver for Inside Secure microread chipset. It supports two\n  physical layers: i2c and MEI. The MEI one depends on a patchset that's\n  been sent to Greg Kroah-Hartman for inclusion into the 3.9 kernel [1]. The\n  dependency is a KConfig one which means this code is not buildable as long\n  as the MEI API is not usptream.\"\n\n\"This 3rd NFC pull request for 3.9 contains a fix for the microread MEI\nphysical layer support, as the MEI bus API changed.\n\nFrom the MEI code, we now pass the MEI id back to the driver probe routine,\nand we also pass a name and a MEI id table through the mei_bus_driver\nstructure. A few renames as well like e.g. mei_bus_driver to mei_driver or\nmei_bus_client to mei_device in order to be closer to the driver model\npractices.\"\n\nFor the ath6kl bits, Kalle says:\n\n\"There's not anything special here, most of the patches are just code\ncleanup. The only functional changes are using the beacon interval from user\nspace and fixing a crash which happens when inserting and removing the\nmodule in a loop.\"\n\nAlso, I pulled the wireless tree in order to resolve some pending\nmerge issues.  On top of that, there is a bunch of work on brcmfmac\nthat leads up to P2P support.
