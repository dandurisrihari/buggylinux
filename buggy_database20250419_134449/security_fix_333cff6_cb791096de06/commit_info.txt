Full commit message:
powercap/drivers/idle_inject: Specify idle state max latency

Currently the idle injection framework uses the play_idle() function
which puts the current CPU in an idle state. The idle state is the
deepest one, as specified by the latency constraint when calling the
subsequent play_idle_precise() function with the INT_MAX.

The idle_injection is used by the cpuidle_cooling device which
computes the idle / run duration to mitigate the temperature by
injecting idle cycles. The cooling device has no control on the depth
of the idle state.

Allow finer control of the idle injection mechanism by allowing to
specify the latency for the idle state. Thus the cooling device has
the ability to have a guarantee on the exit latency of the idle states
it is injecting.
