Full commit message:
x86/mm: Fix NX bit clearing issue in kernel_map_pages_in_pgd

The following commit:

  15f003d20782 ("x86/mm/pat: Don't implicitly allow _PAGE_RW in kernel_map_pages_in_pgd()")

modified kernel_map_pages_in_pgd() to manage writable permissions
of memory mappings in the EFI page table in a different way, but
in the process, it removed the ability to clear NX attributes from
read-only mappings, by clobbering the clear mask if _PAGE_RW is not
being requested.

Failure to remove the NX attribute from read-only mappings is
unlikely to be a security issue, but it does prevent us from
tightening the permissions in the EFI page tables going forward,
so let's fix it now.
