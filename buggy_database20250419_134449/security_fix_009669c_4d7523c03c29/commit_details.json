  "body": "A recent patch set to rework the usage of debugfs and to add fault\ninjection capabilities via debugfs files to the hfi1 driver introduced a\nbuild error that only shows up when debugfs is fully disabled.  The\npatchset mistakenly defines some empty stub functions in two different\nheaders when debugfs is disabled.  Remove the set that shouldn't have\nbeen there to resolve the issue.\n\nFixes: a74d5307caba (\"IB/hfi1: Rework fault injection machinery\")\nSigned-off-by: Doug Ledford <dledford@redhat.com>",
