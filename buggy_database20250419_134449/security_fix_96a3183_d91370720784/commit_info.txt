Full commit message:
Bluetooth: Set authentication requirement before requesting it

The authentication requirement got only updated when the security level
increased. This is a wrong behavior. The authentication requirement is
read by the Bluetooth daemon to make proper decisions when handling the
IO capabilities exchange. So set the value that is currently expected by
the higher layers like L2CAP and RFCOMM.
