    drm/i915: Use fault-injection to force the shrinker to run in live GTT tests
    
    It is possible whilst allocating the page-directory tree for a ppgtt
    bind that the shrinker may run and reap unused parts of the tree. If the
    shrinker happens to remove a chunk of the tree that the
    allocate_va_range has already processed, we may then try to insert into
    the dangling tree. This test uses the fault-injection framework to force
    the shrinker to be invoked before we allocate new pages, i.e. new chunks
    of the PD tree.
