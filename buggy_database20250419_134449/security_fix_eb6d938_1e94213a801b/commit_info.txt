  "Really final for-rc pull request for 4.19

   Ok, so last week I thought we had sent our final pull request for
   4.19.  Well, wouldn't ya know someone went and found a couple Spectre
   v1 fixes were needed :-/.  So, a couple *very* small specter patches
   for this (hopefully) final -rc week."
