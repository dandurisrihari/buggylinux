Full commit message:
KVM: s390: interpretive execution of SIGP EXTERNAL CALL

If the sigp interpretation facility is installed, most SIGP EXTERNAL CALL
operations will be interpreted instead of intercepted. A partial execution
interception will occurr at the sending cpu only if the target cpu is in the
wait state ("W" bit in the cpuflags set). Instruction interception will only
happen in error cases (e.g. cpu addr invalid).

As a sending cpu might set the external call interrupt pending flags at the
target cpu at every point in time, we can't handle this kind of interrupt using
our kvm interrupt injection mechanism. The injection will be done automatically
by the SIE when preparing the start of the target cpu.
