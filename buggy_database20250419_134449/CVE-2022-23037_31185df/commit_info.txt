CVE Identifiers:
- CVE-2022-23037

Full commit message:
xen/netfront: don't use gnttab_query_foreign_access() for mapped status

It isn't enough to check whether a grant is still being in use by
calling gnttab_query_foreign_access(), as a mapping could be realized
by the other side just after having called that function.

In case the call was done in preparation of revoking a grant it is
better to do so via gnttab_end_foreign_access_ref() and check the
success of that operation instead.

This is CVE-2022-23037 / part of XSA-396.
