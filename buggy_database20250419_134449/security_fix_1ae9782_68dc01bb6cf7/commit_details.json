  "body": "This patch adds crypto_aead which is the interface for AEAD\n(Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data) algorithms.\n\nAEAD algorithms perform authentication and encryption in one\nstep.  Traditionally users (such as IPsec) would use two\ndifferent crypto algorithms to perform these.  With AEAD\nthis comes down to one algorithm and one operation.\n\nOf course if traditional algorithms were used we'd still\nbe doing two operations underneath.  However, real AEAD\nalgorithms may allow the underlying operations to be\noptimised as well.\n\nSigned-off-by: Herbert Xu <herbert@gondor.apana.org.au>",
