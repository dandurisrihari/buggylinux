Full commit message:
nvme-fabrics: replace deprecated strncpy with strscpy

strncpy() is deprecated for use on NUL-terminated destination strings
[1] and as such we should prefer more robust and less ambiguous string
interfaces.

We expect both data->subsysnqn and data->hostnqn to be NUL-terminated
based on their usage with format specifier ("%s"):
fabrics.c:
322: dev_err(ctrl->device,
323:   "%s, subsysnqn \"%s\"\n",
324:   inv_data, data->subsysnqn);
...
349: dev_err(ctrl->device,
350: 	 "Connect for subsystem %s is not allowed, hostnqn: %s\n",
351: 	 data->subsysnqn, data->hostnqn);

Moreover, there's no need to NUL-pad since `data` is zero-allocated
already in fabrics.c:
383: data = kzalloc(sizeof(*data), GFP_KERNEL);
... therefore any further NUL-padding is rendered useless.

Considering the above, a suitable replacement is `strscpy` [2] due to
the fact that it guarantees NUL-termination on the destination buffer
without unnecessarily NUL-padding.

I opted not to switch NVMF_NQN_SIZE to sizeof(data->xyz) because the
size is defined as:
|       /* NQN names in commands fields specified one size */
|       #define NVMF_NQN_FIELD_LEN	256

... while NVMF_NQN_SIZE is defined as:
|       /* However the max length of a qualified name is another size */
|       #define NVMF_NQN_SIZE		223

Since 223 seems pretty magic, I'm not going to touch it.
