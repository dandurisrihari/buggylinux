    ipv6: ioam: Support for IOAM injection with lwtunnels
    
    Add support for the IOAM inline insertion (only for the host-to-host use case)
    which is per-route configured with lightweight tunnels. The target is iproute2
    and the patch is ready. It will be posted as soon as this patchset is merged.
    Here is an overview:
    
    $ ip -6 ro ad fc00::1/128 encap ioam6 trace type 0x800000 ns 1 size 12 dev eth0
    
    This example configures an IOAM Pre-allocated Trace option attached to the
    fc00::1/128 prefix. The IOAM namespace (ns) is 1, the size of the pre-allocated
    trace data block is 12 octets (size) and only the first IOAM data (bit 0:
    hop_limit + node id) is included in the trace (type) represented as a bitfield.
    
    The reason why the in-transit (IPv6-in-IPv6 encapsulation) use case is not
    implemented is explained on the patchset cover.
