  "body": "The input/output parameter changes are pretty intrusive, possibly\ninvolving with the buffer resizing operation.  Hence those should be\nperformed exclusively; otherwise some ugly race could happen.\n\nThis patch puts the existing open_mutex for snd_rawmidi_input_params()\nand *_output_params() for protecting the concurrent calls.  Since\nthose are exported, it's also meant for hardening from the external\ncalls, too.\n\nLink: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20220617144051.18985-4-tiwai@suse.de\nSigned-off-by: Takashi Iwai <tiwai@suse.de>",
