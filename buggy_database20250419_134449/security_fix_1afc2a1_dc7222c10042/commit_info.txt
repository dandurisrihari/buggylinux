Full commit message:
Bluetooth: Fix SMP security level when we have no IO capabilities

When the local IO capability is NoInputNoOutput any attempt to convert
the remote authentication requirement to a target security level is
futile. This patch makes sure that we set the target security level at
most to MEDIUM if the local IO capability is NoInputNoOutput.
