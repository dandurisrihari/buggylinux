Full commit message:
accel/habanalabs: refactor deprecated strncpy

`strncpy` is deprecated for use on NUL-terminated destination strings [1].

A suitable replacement is `strscpy` [2] due to the fact that it
guarantees NUL-termination on its destination buffer argument which is
_not_ the case for `strncpy`!

There is likely no bug happening in this case since HL_STR_MAX is
strictly larger than all source strings. Nonetheless, prefer a safer and
more robust interface.

It should also be noted that `strscpy` will not pad like `strncpy`. If
this NUL-padding behavior is _required_ we should use `strscpy_pad`
instead of `strscpy`.
