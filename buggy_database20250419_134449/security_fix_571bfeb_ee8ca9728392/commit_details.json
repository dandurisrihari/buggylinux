  "body": "`strncpy` is deprecated for use on NUL-terminated destination strings [1].\n\nA suitable replacement is `strscpy` [2] due to the fact that it\nguarantees NUL-termination on its destination buffer argument which is\n_not_ the case for `strncpy`!\n\nThere is likely no bug happening in this case since HL_STR_MAX is\nstrictly larger than all source strings. Nonetheless, prefer a safer and\nmore robust interface.\n\nIt should also be noted that `strscpy` will not pad like `strncpy`. If\nthis NUL-padding behavior is _required_ we should use `strscpy_pad`\ninstead of `strscpy`.\n\nLink: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#strncpy-on-nul-terminated-strings [1]\nLink: https://manpages.debian.org/testing/linux-manual-4.8/strscpy.9.en.html [2]\nLink: https://github.com/KSPP/linux/issues/90\nCc: linux-hardening@vger.kernel.org\nSigned-off-by: Justin Stitt <justinstitt@google.com>\nReviewed-by: Stanislaw Gruszka <stanislaw.gruszka@linux.intel.com>\nReviewed-by: Oded Gabbay <ogabbay@kernel.org>\nSigned-off-by: Oded Gabbay <ogabbay@kernel.org>",
