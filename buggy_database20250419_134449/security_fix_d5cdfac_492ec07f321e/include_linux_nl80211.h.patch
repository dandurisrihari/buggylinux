    cfg80211: Add local-state-change-only auth/deauth/disassoc
    
    cfg80211 is quite strict on allowing authentication and association
    commands only in certain states. In order to meet these requirements,
    user space applications may need to clear authentication or
    association state in some cases. Currently, this can be done with
    deauth/disassoc command, but that ends up sending out Deauthentication
    or Disassociation frame unnecessarily. Add a new nl80211 attribute to
    allow this sending of the frame be skipped, but with all other
    deauth/disassoc operations being completed.
    
    Similar state change is also needed for IEEE 802.11r FT protocol in
    the FT-over-DS case which does not use Authentication frame exchange
    in a transition to another BSS. For this to work with cfg80211, an
    authentication entry needs to be created for the target BSS without
    sending out an Authentication frame. The nl80211 authentication
    command can be used for this purpose, too, with the new attribute to
    indicate that the command is only for changing local state. This
    enables wpa_supplicant to complete FT-over-DS transition successfully.
