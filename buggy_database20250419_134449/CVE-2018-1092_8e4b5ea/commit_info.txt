CVE Identifiers:
- CVE-2018-1092

Full commit message:
ext4: fail ext4_iget for root directory if unallocated

If the root directory has an i_links_count of zero, then when the file
system is mounted, then when ext4_fill_super() notices the problem and
tries to call iput() the root directory in the error return path,
ext4_evict_inode() will try to free the inode on disk, before all of
the file system structures are set up, and this will result in an OOPS
caused by a NULL pointer dereference.

This issue has been assigned CVE-2018-1092.
