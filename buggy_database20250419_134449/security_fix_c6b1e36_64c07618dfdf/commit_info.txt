Full commit message:
Merge branch 'for-4.13/block' of git://git.kernel.dk/linux-block

Pull core block/IO updates from Jens Axboe:
 "This is the main pull request for the block layer for 4.13. Not a huge
  round in terms of features, but there's a lot of churn related to some
  core cleanups.

  Note this depends on the UUID tree pull request, that Christoph
  already sent out.

  This pull request contains:

   - A series from Christoph, unifying the error/stats codes in the
     block layer. We now use blk_status_t everywhere, instead of using
     different schemes for different places.

   - Also from Christoph, some cleanups around request allocation and IO
     scheduler interactions in blk-mq.

   - And yet another series from Christoph, cleaning up how we handle
     and do bounce buffering in the block layer.

   - A blk-mq debugfs series from Bart, further improving on the support
     we have for exporting internal information to aid debugging IO
     hangs or stalls.

   - Also from Bart, a series that cleans up the request initialization
     differences across types of devices.

   - A series from Goldwyn Rodrigues, allowing the block layer to return
     failure if we will block and the user asked for non-blocking.

   - Patch from Hannes for supporting setting loop devices block size to
     that of the underlying device.

   - Two series of patches from Javier, fixing various issues with
     lightnvm, particular around pblk.

   - A series from me, adding support for write hints. This comes with
     NVMe support as well, so applications can help guide data placement
     on flash to improve performance, latencies, and write
     amplification.

   - A series from Ming, improving and hardening blk-mq support for
     stopping/starting and quiescing hardware queues.

   - Two pull requests for NVMe updates. Nothing major on the feature
     side, but lots of cleanups and bug fixes. From the usual crew.

   - A series from Neil Brown, greatly improving the bio rescue set
     support. Most notably, this kills the bio rescue work queues, if we
     don't really need them.

   - Lots of other little bug fixes that are all over the place"
