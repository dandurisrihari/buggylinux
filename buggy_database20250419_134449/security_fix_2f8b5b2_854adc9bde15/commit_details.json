On HS devices, appropriate PPA should do the workarounds as\nwell.\n\nHowever, the configuration is only done for secondary core, since it is\nexpected that firmware/bootloader will have enabled the required\nconfiguration for the primary boot core (note: bootloaders typically\nwill NOT enable secondary processors, since it has no need to do so).\n\nSigned-off-by: Nishanth Menon <nm@ti.com>\nSigned-off-by: Tony Lindgren <tony@atomide.com>",
