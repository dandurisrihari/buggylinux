Full commit message:
staging: rtl8723bs: Fix IEEE80211 authentication algorithm constants.

This driver's local ieee80211 include file defines the constants
AUTH_ALG_* to represent authenication algorithm options.  However,
these constants are defined in 'linux/ieee80211.h' as WLAN_AUTH_*,
and have the correct values.
