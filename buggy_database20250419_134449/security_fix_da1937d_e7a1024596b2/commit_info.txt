Full commit message:
arm64: dts: qcom: sm8350: Fix MPSS memory length

The address space in MPSS/Modem PAS (Peripheral Authentication Service)
remoteproc node should point to the QDSP PUB address space
(QDSP6...SS_PUB) which has a length of 0x10000.  Value of 0x4040 was
copied from older DTS, but it grew since then.

This should have no functional impact on Linux users, because PAS loader
does not use this address space at all.
