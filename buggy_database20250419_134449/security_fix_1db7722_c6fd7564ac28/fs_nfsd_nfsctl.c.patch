    Merge branch 'for-3.10' of git://linux-nfs.org/~bfields/linux
    
    Pull nfsd changes from J Bruce Fields:
     "Highlights include:
    
       - Some more DRC cleanup and performance work from Jeff Layton
    
       - A gss-proxy upcall from Simo Sorce: currently krb5 mounts to the
         server using credentials from Active Directory often fail due to
         limitations of the svcgssd upcall interface.  This replacement
         lifts those limitations.  The existing upcall is still supported
         for backwards compatibility.
    
       - More NFSv4.1 support: at this point, if a user with a current
         client who upgrades from 4.0 to 4.1 should see no regressions.  In
         theory we do everything a 4.1 server is required to do.  Patches
         for a couple minor exceptions are ready for 3.11, and with those
         and some more testing I'd like to turn 4.1 on by default in 3.11."
    
    Fix up semantic conflict as per Stephen Rothwell and linux-next:
    
    Commit 030d794bf498 ("SUNRPC: Use gssproxy upcall for server RPCGSS
    authentication") adds two new users of "PDE(inode)->data", but we're
    supposed to use "PDE_DATA(inode)" instead since commit d9dda78bad87
    ("procfs: new helper - PDE_DATA(inode)").
    
    The old PDE() macro is no longer available since commit c30480b92cf4
    ("proc: Make the PROC_I() and PDE() macros internal to procfs")
