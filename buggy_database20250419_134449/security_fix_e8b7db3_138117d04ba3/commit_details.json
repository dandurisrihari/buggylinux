  "body": "Currently, VMbus drivers use pointers into guest memory as request IDs\nfor interactions with Hyper-V. To be more robust in the face of errors\nor malicious behavior from a compromised Hyper-V, avoid exposing\nguest memory addresses to Hyper-V. Also avoid Hyper-V giving back a\nbad request ID that is then treated as the address of a guest data\nstructure with no validation. Instead, encapsulate these memory\naddresses and provide small integers as request IDs.\n\nSigned-off-by: Andres Beltran <lkmlabelt@gmail.com>\nCo-developed-by: Andrea Parri (Microsoft) <parri.andrea@gmail.com>\nSigned-off-by: Andrea Parri (Microsoft) <parri.andrea@gmail.com>\nReviewed-by: Michael Kelley <mikelley@microsoft.com>\nReviewed-by: Wei Liu <wei.liu@kernel.org>\nLink: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20201109100402.8946-2-parri.andrea@gmail.com\nSigned-off-by: Wei Liu <wei.liu@kernel.org>",
