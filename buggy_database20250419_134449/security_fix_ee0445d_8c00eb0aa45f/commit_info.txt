MAINTAINERS: adjust entries in FORTIFY_SOURCE and KERNEL HARDENING

Commit db6fe4d61ece ("lib: Move KUnit tests into tests/ subdirectory") adds
a file entry to the non-existing file scripts/test_fortify.sh. Probably,
this entry intends to refer to ./lib/test_fortify/test_fortify.sh, though.
As that file is already covered by the entry lib/test_fortify/*, there is
no need for a separate file entry. So, drop the unnecessary file entry to
the test_fortify script.

Further, this commit misses to adjust the entry referring to
lib/usercopy_kunit.c, which is moved to lib/tests. So, also adjust that
file entry.

Fixes: db6fe4d61ece ("lib: Move KUnit tests into tests/ subdirectory")
