Probably,\nthis entry intends to refer to ./lib/test_fortify/test_fortify.sh, though.\nAs that file is already covered by the entry lib/test_fortify/*, there is\nno need for a separate file entry. So, drop the unnecessary file entry to\nthe test_fortify script.\n\nFurther, this commit misses to adjust the entry referring to\nlib/usercopy_kunit.c, which is moved to lib/tests. So, also adjust that\nfile entry.\n\nFixes: db6fe4d61ece (\"lib: Move KUnit tests into tests/ subdirectory\")\n\nSigned-off-by: Lukas Bulwahn <lukas.bulwahn@redhat.com>\nLink: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20250217100643.20182-1-lukas.bulwahn@redhat.com\nSigned-off-by: Kees Cook <kees@kernel.org>",
