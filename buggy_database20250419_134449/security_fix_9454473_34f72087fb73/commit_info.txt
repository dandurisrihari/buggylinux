Full commit message:
Merge tag 'for-linus-20180210' of git://git.kernel.dk/linux-block

Pull block fixes from Jens Axboe:
 "A few fixes to round off the merge window on the block side:

   - a set of bcache fixes by way of Michael Lyle, from the usual bcache
     suspects.

   - add a simple-to-hook-into function for bpf EIO error injection.

   - fix blk-wbt that mischarectized flushes as reads. Improve the logic
     so that flushes and writes are accounted as writes, and only reads
     as reads. From me.

   - fix requeue crash in BFQ, from Paolo"
