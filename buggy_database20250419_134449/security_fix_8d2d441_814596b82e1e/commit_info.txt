Full commit message:
Merge branch 'for-linus' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/sage/ceph-client

Pull Ceph updates from Sage Weil:
 "There is a lot of refactoring and hardening of the libceph and rbd
  code here from Ilya that fix various smaller bugs, and a few more
  important fixes with clone overlap.  The main fix is a critical change
  to the request_fn handling to not sleep that was exposed by the recent
  mutex changes (which will also go to the 3.16 stable series).

  Yan Zheng has several fixes in here for CephFS fixing ACL handling,
  time stamps, and request resends when the MDS restarts.

  Finally, there are a few cleanups from Himangi Saraogi based on
  Coccinelle"
