Merge branch 'net-devname_alloc_cleanups'

Rasmus Villemoes says:

====================
net: core: devname allocation cleanups

It's somewhat confusing to have both dev_alloc_name and
dev_get_valid_name. I can't see why the former is less strict than the
latter, so make them (or rather dev_alloc_name_ns and
dev_get_valid_name) equivalent, hardening dev_alloc_name() a little.

Obvious follow-up patches would be to only export one function, and
make dev_alloc_name a static inline wrapper for that (whichever name
is chosen for the exported interface). But maybe there is a good
reason the two exported interfaces do different checking, so I'll
refrain from including the trivial but tree-wide renaming in this
series.
