    reiserfs: fix permissions on .reiserfs_priv
    
    Commit 677c9b2e393a0cd203bd54e9c18b012b2c73305a ("reiserfs: remove
    privroot hiding in lookup") removed the magic from the lookup code to hide
    the .reiserfs_priv directory since it was getting loaded at mount-time
    instead.  The intent was that the entry would be hidden from the user via
    a poisoned d_compare, but this was faulty.
    
    This introduced a security issue where unprivileged users could access and
    modify extended attributes or ACLs belonging to other users, including
    root.
    
    This patch resolves the issue by properly hiding .reiserfs_priv.  This was
    the intent of the xattr poisoning code, but it appears to have never
    worked as expected.  This is fixed by using d_revalidate instead of
    d_compare.
    
    This patch makes -oexpose_privroot a no-op.  I'm fine leaving it this way.
    The effort involved in working out the corner cases wrt permissions and
    caching outweigh the benefit of the feature.
