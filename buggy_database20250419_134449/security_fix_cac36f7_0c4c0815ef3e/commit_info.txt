Full commit message:
reiserfs: fix permissions on .reiserfs_priv

Commit 677c9b2e393a0cd203bd54e9c18b012b2c73305a ("reiserfs: remove
privroot hiding in lookup") removed the magic from the lookup code to hide
the .reiserfs_priv directory since it was getting loaded at mount-time
instead.  The intent was that the entry would be hidden from the user via
a poisoned d_compare, but this was faulty.

This introduced a security issue where unprivileged users could access and
modify extended attributes or ACLs belonging to other users, including
root.

This patch resolves the issue by properly hiding .reiserfs_priv.  This was
the intent of the xattr poisoning code, but it appears to have never
worked as expected.  This is fixed by using d_revalidate instead of
d_compare.

This patch makes -oexpose_privroot a no-op.  I'm fine leaving it this way.
The effort involved in working out the corner cases wrt permissions and
caching outweigh the benefit of the feature.
