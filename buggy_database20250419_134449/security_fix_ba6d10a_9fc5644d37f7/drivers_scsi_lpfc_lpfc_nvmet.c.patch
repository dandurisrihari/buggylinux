    Merge tag 'scsi-misc' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jejb/scsi
    
    Pull SCSI updates from James Bottomley:
     "This is mostly update of the usual drivers: qla2xxx, hpsa, lpfc, ufs,
      mpt3sas, ibmvscsi, megaraid_sas, bnx2fc and hisi_sas as well as the
      removal of the osst driver (I heard from Willem privately that he
      would like the driver removed because all his test hardware has
      failed). Plus number of minor changes, spelling fixes and other
      trivia.
    
      The big merge conflict this time around is the SPDX licence tags.
      Following discussion on linux-next, we believe our version to be more
      accurate than the one in the tree, so the resolution is to take our
      version for all the SPDX conflicts"
    
    Note on the SPDX license tag conversion conflicts: the SCSI tree had
    done its own SPDX conversion, which in some cases conflicted with the
    treewide ones done by Thomas & co.
    
    In almost all cases, the conflicts were purely syntactic: the SCSI tree
    used the old-style SPDX tags ("GPL-2.0" and "GPL-2.0+") while the
    treewide conversion had used the new-style ones ("GPL-2.0-only" and
    "GPL-2.0-or-later").
    
    In these cases I picked the new-style one.
    
    In a few cases, the SPDX conversion was actually different, though.  As
    explained by James above, and in more detail in a pre-pull-request
    thread:
    
     "The other problem is actually substantive: In the libsas code Luben
      Tuikov originally specified gpl 2.0 only by dint of stating:
    
      * This file is licensed under GPLv2.
    
      In all the libsas files, but then muddied the water by quoting GPLv2
      verbatim (which includes the or later than language). So for these
      files Christoph did the conversion to v2 only SPDX tags and Thomas
      converted to v2 or later tags"
    
    So in those cases, where the spdx tag substantially mattered, I took the
    SCSI tree conversion of it, but then also took the opportunity to turn
    the old-style "GPL-2.0" into a new-style "GPL-2.0-only" tag.
    
    Similarly, when there were whitespace differences or other differences
    to the comments around the copyright notices, I took the version from
    the SCSI tree as being the more specific conversion.
    
    Finally, in the spdx conversions that had no conflicts (because the
    treewide ones hadn't been done for those files), I just took the SCSI
    tree version as-is, even if it was old-style.  The old-style conversions
    are perfectly valid, even if the "-only" and "-or-later" versions are
    perhaps more descriptive.
