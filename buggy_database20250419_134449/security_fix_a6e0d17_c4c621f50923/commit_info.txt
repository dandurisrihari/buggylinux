Full commit message:
scsi: target: iscsi: Control authentication per ACL

Add acls/{ACL}/attrib/authentication attribute that controls authentication
for particular ACL. By default, this attribute inherits a value of the
authentication attribute of the target port group to keep backward
compatibility.

Authentication attribute has 3 states:

 "0" - authentication is turned off for this ACL

 "1" - authentication is required for this ACL

 "-1" - authentication is inherited from TPG
