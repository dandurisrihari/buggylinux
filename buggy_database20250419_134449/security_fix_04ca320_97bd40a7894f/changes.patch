+	  Pointer authentication (part of the ARMv8.3 Extensions) provides
+	  instructions for signing and authenticating pointers against secret
+	  keys, which can be used to mitigate Return Oriented Programming (ROP)
+	  and other attacks.
+
+	  This option enables these instructions at EL0 (i.e. for userspace).
+
+	  Choosing this option will cause the kernel to initialise secret keys
+	  for each process at exec() time, with these keys being
+	  context-switched along with the process.
+
+	  The feature is detected at runtime. If the feature is not present in
+	  hardware it will not be advertised to userspace nor will it be
+	  enabled.
