Whilst an attacker would need to get the stars to align here,\nit might be sufficient with enough calibration so perform BP hardening\nin the rare case that we see a kernel address in the ELR when handling\nan IRQ from EL0.\n\nReported-by: Dan Hettena <dhettena@nvidia.com>\nReviewed-by: Marc Zyngier <marc.zyngier@arm.com>\nSigned-off-by: Will Deacon <will.deacon@arm.com>\nSigned-off-by: Catalin Marinas <catalin.marinas@arm.com>",
