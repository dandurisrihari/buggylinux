Full commit message:
arm64: dts: qcom: sm8650: Fix ADSP memory base and length

The address space in ADSP PAS (Peripheral Authentication Service)
remoteproc node should point to the QDSP PUB address space
(QDSP6...SS_PUB): 0x0680_0000 with length of 0x10000.

0x3000_0000, value used so far, is the main region of CDSP.  Downstream
DTS uses 0x0300_0000, which is oddly similar to 0x3000_0000, yet quite
different and points to unused area.

Correct the base address and length, which also moves the node to
different place to keep things sorted by unit address.  The diff looks
big, but only the unit address and "reg" property were changed.  This
should have no functional impact on Linux users, because PAS loader does
not use this address space at all.
