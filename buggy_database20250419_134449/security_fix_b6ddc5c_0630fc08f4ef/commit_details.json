Downstream\nDTS uses 0x0300_0000, which is oddly similar to 0x3000_0000, yet quite\ndifferent and points to unused area.\n\nCorrect the base address and length, which also moves the node to\ndifferent place to keep things sorted by unit address.  The diff looks\nbig, but only the unit address and \"reg\" property were changed.  This\nshould have no functional impact on Linux users, because PAS loader does\nnot use this address space at all.\n\nFixes: 10e024671295 (\"arm64: dts: qcom: sm8650: add interconnect dependent device nodes\")\nCc: stable@vger.kernel.org\nReviewed-by: Neil Armstrong <neil.armstrong@linaro.org>\nReviewed-by: Konrad Dybcio <konrad.dybcio@oss.qualcomm.com>\nSigned-off-by: Krzysztof Kozlowski <krzysztof.kozlowski@linaro.org>\nLink: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20241213-dts-qcom-cdsp-mpss-base-address-v3-10-2e0036fccd8d@linaro.org\nSigned-off-by: Bjorn Andersson <andersson@kernel.org>",
