    Documentation/llvm: refresh docs
    
    Recent fixes for an embargoed hardware security vulnerability failed to
    link with ld.lld (LLVM's linker).  [0]  To be fair, our documentation
    mentions ``CC=clang`` foremost with ``LLVM=1`` being buried "below the
    fold."
    
    We want to encourage the use of ``LLVM=1`` rather than just
    ``CC=clang``. Make that suggestion "above the fold" and "front and
    center" in our docs.
    
    While here, the following additional changes were made:
    - remove the bit about CROSS_COMPILE setting --target=, that's no longer
      true.
    - Add ARCH=loongarch to the list of maintained targets (though we're
      still working on getting defconfig building cleanly at the moment;
      we're pretty close).
    - Bump ARCH=powerpc from CC=clang to LLVM=1 status.
    - Promote ARCH=riscv from being Maintained to being Supported. Android
      is working towards supporting RISC-V, and we have excellent support
      from multiple companies in this regard.
    - Note that the toolchain distribution on kernel.org has been built with
      profile data from kernel builds.
    - Note how to use ccache with clang.

+``make``.

+Cross Compiling
+---------------
 
-Omitting CROSS_COMPILE
+A single Clang compiler binary (and corresponding LLVM utilities) will
+typically contain all supported back ends, which can help simplify cross
+compiling especially when ``LLVM=1`` is used. If you use only LLVM tools,
+``CROSS_COMPILE`` or target-triple-prefixes become unnecessary. Example::
+
+	make LLVM=1 ARCH=arm64
+
+As an example of mixing LLVM and GNU utilities, for a target like ``ARCH=s390``
+which does not yet have ``ld.lld`` or ``llvm-objcopy`` support, you could
+invoke ``make`` via::
+
+	make LLVM=1 ARCH=s390 LD=s390x-linux-gnu-ld.bfd \
+	  OBJCOPY=s390x-linux-gnu-objcopy
+
+This example will invoke ``s390x-linux-gnu-ld.bfd`` as the linker and
+``s390x-linux-gnu-objcopy``, so ensure those are reachable in your ``$PATH``.
+
+``CROSS_COMPILE`` is not used to prefix the Clang compiler binary (or
+corresponding LLVM utilities) as is the case for GNU utilities when ``LLVM=1``
+is not set.
+
+The LLVM_IAS= argument
 ----------------------
 
-As explained above, ``CROSS_COMPILE`` is used to set ``--target=<triple>``.
+Clang can assemble assembler code. You can pass ``LLVM_IAS=0`` to disable this
+behavior and have Clang invoke the corresponding non-integrated assembler
+instead. Example::
+
+	make LLVM=1 LLVM_IAS=0
+
+``CROSS_COMPILE`` is necessary when cross compiling and ``LLVM_IAS=0``
+is used in order to set ``--prefix=`` for the compiler to find the
+corresponding non-integrated assembler (typically, you don't want to use the
+system assembler when targeting another architecture). Example::
 
-If ``CROSS_COMPILE`` is not specified, the ``--target=<triple>`` is inferred
-from ``ARCH``.
+	make LLVM=1 ARCH=arm LLVM_IAS=0 CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabi-
 
-That means if you use only LLVM tools, ``CROSS_COMPILE`` becomes unnecessary.
 
-For example, to cross-compile the arm64 kernel::
+Ccache
+------
 
-	make ARCH=arm64 LLVM=1
+``ccache`` can be used with ``clang`` to improve subsequent builds, (though
+KBUILD_BUILD_TIMESTAMP_ should be set to a deterministic value between builds
+in order to avoid 100% cache misses, see Reproducible_builds_ for more info):
 
-If ``LLVM_IAS=0`` is specified, ``CROSS_COMPILE`` is also used to derive
-``--prefix=<path>`` to search for the GNU assembler and linker. ::
+	KBUILD_BUILD_TIMESTAMP='' make LLVM=1 CC="ccache clang"
 
-	make ARCH=arm64 LLVM=1 LLVM_IAS=0 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu-
