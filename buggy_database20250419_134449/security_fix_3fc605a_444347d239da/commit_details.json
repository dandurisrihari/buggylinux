  "body": "AUTH_UNIX authentication (the standard with NFS) has a limit of 16 groups ids.\n This causes problems for people in more than 16 groups.\n\nSo allow the server to map a uid into a list of group ids based on local\nknowledge rather depending on the (possibly truncated) list from the client.\n\nIf there is no process on the server responding to upcalls, the gidlist in the\nrequest will still be used.\n\nSigned-off-by: Neil Brown <neilb@suse.de>\nSigned-off-by: Andrew Morton <akpm@linux-foundation.org>\nSigned-off-by: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org>",
