Full commit message:
Bluetooth: Add mgmt_auth_failed event

To properly track bonding completion an event to indicate authentication
failure is needed. This event will be sent whenever an authentication
complete HCI event with a non-zero status comes. It will also be sent
when we're acting in acceptor role for SSP authentication in which case
the controller will send a Simple Pairing Complete event.
