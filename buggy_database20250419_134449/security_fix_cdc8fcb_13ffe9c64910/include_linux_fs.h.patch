    Pull io_uring updates from Jens Axboe:
     "Lots of cleanups in here, hardening the code and/or making it easier
      to read and fixing bugs, but a core feature/change too adding support
      for real async buffered reads. With the latter in place, we just need
      buffered write async support and we're done relying on kthreads for
      the fast path. In detail:
    
       - Cleanup how memory accounting is done on ring setup/free (Bijan)
    
       - sq array offset calculation fixup (Dmitry)
    
       - Consistently handle blocking off O_DIRECT submission path (me)
    
       - Support proper async buffered reads, instead of relying on kthread
         offload for that. This uses the page waitqueue to drive retries
         from task_work, like we handle poll based retry. (me)
    
       - IO completion optimizations (me)
    
       - Fix race with accounting and ring fd install (me)
    
       - Support EPOLLEXCLUSIVE (Jiufei)
    
       - Get rid of the io_kiocb unionizing, made possible by shrinking
         other bits (Pavel)
    
       - Completion side cleanups (Pavel)
    
       - Cleanup REQ_F_ flags handling, and kill off many of them (Pavel)
    
       - Request environment grabbing cleanups (Pavel)
    
       - File and socket read/write cleanups (Pavel)
    
       - Improve kiocb_set_rw_flags() (Pavel)
    
       - Tons of fixes and cleanups (Pavel)
    
       - IORING_SQ_NEED_WAKEUP clear fix (Xiaoguang)"
