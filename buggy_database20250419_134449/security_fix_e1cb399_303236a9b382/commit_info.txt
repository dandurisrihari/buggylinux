Full commit message:
KVM: selftests: aarch64: Abstract the injection functions in vgic_irq

Build an abstraction around the injection functions, so the preparation
and checking around the actual injection can be shared between tests.
All functions are stored as pointers in arrays of kvm_inject_desc's
which include the pointer and what kind of interrupts they can inject.
