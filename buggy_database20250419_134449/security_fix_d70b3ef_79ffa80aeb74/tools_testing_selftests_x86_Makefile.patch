    Merge branch 'x86-core-for-linus' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tip/tip
    
    Pull x86 core updates from Ingo Molnar:
     "There were so many changes in the x86/asm, x86/apic and x86/mm topics
      in this cycle that the topical separation of -tip broke down somewhat -
      so the result is a more traditional architecture pull request,
      collected into the 'x86/core' topic.
    
      The topics were still maintained separately as far as possible, so
      bisectability and conceptual separation should still be pretty good -
      but there were a handful of merge points to avoid excessive
      dependencies (and conflicts) that would have been poorly tested in the
      end.
    
      The next cycle will hopefully be much more quiet (or at least will
      have fewer dependencies).
    
      The main changes in this cycle were:
    
       * x86/apic changes, with related IRQ core changes: (Jiang Liu, Thomas
         Gleixner)
    
         - This is the second and most intrusive part of changes to the x86
           interrupt handling - full conversion to hierarchical interrupt
           domains:
    
              [IOAPIC domain]   -----
                                     |
              [MSI domain]      --------[Remapping domain] ----- [ Vector domain ]
                                     |   (optional)          |
              [HPET MSI domain] -----                        |
                                                             |
              [DMAR domain]     -----------------------------
                                                             |
              [Legacy domain]   -----------------------------
    
           This now reflects the actual hardware and allowed us to distangle
           the domain specific code from the underlying parent domain, which
           can be optional in the case of interrupt remapping.  It's a clear
           separation of functionality and removes quite some duct tape
           constructs which plugged the remap code between ioapic/msi/hpet
           and the vector management.
    
         - Intel IOMMU IRQ remapping enhancements, to allow direct interrupt
           injection into guests (Feng Wu)
    
       * x86/asm changes:
    
         - Tons of cleanups and small speedups, micro-optimizations.  This
           is in preparation to move a good chunk of the low level entry
           code from assembly to C code (Denys Vlasenko, Andy Lutomirski,
           Brian Gerst)
    
         - Moved all system entry related code to a new home under
           arch/x86/entry/ (Ingo Molnar)
    
         - Removal of the fragile and ugly CFI dwarf debuginfo annotations.
           Conversion to C will reintroduce many of them - but meanwhile
           they are only getting in the way, and the upstream kernel does
           not rely on them (Ingo Molnar)
    
         - NOP handling refinements. (Borislav Petkov)
    
       * x86/mm changes:
    
         - Big PAT and MTRR rework: making the code more robust and
           preparing to phase out exposing direct MTRR interfaces to drivers -
           in favor of using PAT driven interfaces (Toshi Kani, Luis R
           Rodriguez, Borislav Petkov)
    
         - New ioremap_wt()/set_memory_wt() interfaces to support
           Write-Through cached memory mappings.  This is especially
           important for good performance on NVDIMM hardware (Toshi Kani)
    
       * x86/ras changes:
    
         - Add support for deferred errors on AMD (Aravind Gopalakrishnan)
    
           This is an important RAS feature which adds hardware support for
           poisoned data.  That means roughly that the hardware marks data
           which it has detected as corrupted but wasn't able to correct, as
           poisoned data and raises an APIC interrupt to signal that in the
           form of a deferred error.  It is the OS's responsibility then to
           take proper recovery action and thus prolonge system lifetime as
           far as possible.
    
         - Add support for Intel "Local MCE"s: upcoming CPUs will support
           CPU-local MCE interrupts, as opposed to the traditional system-
           wide broadcasted MCE interrupts (Ashok Raj)
    
         - Misc cleanups (Borislav Petkov)
    
       * x86/platform changes:
    
         - Intel Atom SoC updates
    
      ... and lots of other cleanups, fixlets and other changes - see the
      shortlog and the Git log for details"
