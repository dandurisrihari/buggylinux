Full commit message:
ubifs: authentication: Authenticate LPT

The LPT needs to be authenticated aswell. Since the LPT is only written
during commit it is enough to authenticate the whole LPT with a single
hash which is stored in the master node. Only the leaf nodes (pnodes)
are hashed which makes the implementation much simpler than it would be
to hash the complete LPT.
