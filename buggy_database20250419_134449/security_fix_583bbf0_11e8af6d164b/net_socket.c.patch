    io_uring: allow tcp ancillary data for __sys_recvmsg_sock()
    
    For TCP tx zero-copy, the kernel notifies the process of completions by
    queuing completion notifications on the socket error queue. This patch
    allows reading these notifications via recvmsg to support TCP tx
    zero-copy.
    
    Ancillary data was originally disallowed due to privilege escalation
    via io_uring's offloading of sendmsg() onto a kernel thread with kernel
    credentials (https://crbug.com/project-zero/1975). So, we must ensure
    that the socket type is one where the ancillary data types that are
    delivered on recvmsg are plain data (no file descriptors or values that
    are translated based on the identity of the calling process).
    
    This was tested by using io_uring to call recvmsg on the MSG_ERRQUEUE
    with tx zero-copy enabled. Before this patch, we received -EINVALID from
    this specific code path. After this patch, we could read tcp tx
    zero-copy completion notifications from the MSG_ERRQUEUE.
