    wlcore: add new reg-domain configuration command
    
    In 18xx the calibration process of the PHY Cortex domain
    requires to perform an active calibration of the channel
    before it can be used for transmission. To fulfill world
    wide regulatory restrictions, fw should be always
    synchronized/updated with current CRDA configuration.
    Add a new "CMD_DFS_CHANNEL_CONFIG" command to update the
    fw with current reg-domain, this command passes a bit map
    of channels that are allowed to be used for transmission.
    
    The driver shall update the fw during initialization and
    after each change in the current reg-domain
    configuration. The driver will save the channel number of
    incoming beacons during the scan process, as they might
    be a result of the passive scan on
    "IEEE80211_CHAN_PASSIVE_SCAN" channel and will update the
    fw accordingly once the scan is finished, the purpose of
    this is to be ready in case of the authentication request
    on one of these disabled (uncalibrated) channels.
    
    The new command requires to wait for the fw completion
    event "DFS_CHANNELS_CONFIG_COMPLETE_EVENT".
    
    No scan commands (including the sched scan) can be
    executed concurrently with the "CMD_DFS_CHANNEL_CONFIG",
    wl->mutex ensures that.
    
    [Arik - move reset of reg_ch_conf_last to safe place inside
    op_stop_locked]
    [Eliad - adjust to new event waiting api]
