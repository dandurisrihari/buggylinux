CVE Identifiers:
- CVE-2018-10853

Full commit message:
kvm: x86: use correct privilege level for sgdt/sidt/fxsave/fxrstor access

The functions that were used in the emulation of fxrstor, fxsave, sgdt and
sidt were originally meant for task switching, and as such they did not
check privilege levels.  This is very bad when the same functions are used
in the emulation of unprivileged instructions.  This is CVE-2018-10853.

The obvious fix is to add a new argument to ops->read_std and ops->write_std,
which decides whether the access is a "system" access or should use the
processor's CPL.
