    x86/speculation: Add force option to GDS mitigation
    
    The Gather Data Sampling (GDS) vulnerability allows malicious software
    to infer stale data previously stored in vector registers. This may
    include sensitive data such as cryptographic keys. GDS is mitigated in
    microcode, and systems with up-to-date microcode are protected by
    default. However, any affected system that is running with older
    microcode will still be vulnerable to GDS attacks.
    
    Since the gather instructions used by the attacker are part of the
    AVX2 and AVX512 extensions, disabling these extensions prevents gather
    instructions from being executed, thereby mitigating the system from
    GDS. Disabling AVX2 is sufficient, but we don't have the granularity
    to do this. The XCR0[2] disables AVX, with no option to just disable
    AVX2.
    
    Add a kernel parameter gather_data_sampling=force that will enable the
    microcode mitigation if available, otherwise it will disable AVX on
    affected systems.
    
    This option will be ignored if cmdline mitigations=off.
    
    This is a *big* hammer.  It is known to break buggy userspace that
    uses incomplete, buggy AVX enumeration.  Unfortunately, such userspace
    does exist in the wild:
