  "body": "Currently, cfg80211 rejects capability updates for existing entries\nand as a result it's impossible to update entries that were added\nunassociated, but that is necessary to go through the full station\nstates from userspace, adding a station before authentication etc.\n\nFix this by allowing updates to capabilities for stations that the\ndriver (or mac80211) assigned unassociated state. Drivers setting\nthe full station state support flag must use the new station type\nfor proper operation.\n\nSigned-off-by: Ayala Beker <ayala.beker@intel.com>\nSigned-off-by: Luca Coelho <luciano.coelho@intel.com>\nSigned-off-by: Johannes Berg <johannes.berg@intel.com>",
