Full commit message:
KVM: x86 emulator: Allow accessing IDT via emulator ops

The patch adds a new member get_idt() to x86_emulate_ops.
It also adds a function to get the idt in order to be used by the emulator.

This is needed for real mode interrupt injection and the emulation of int
instructions.
