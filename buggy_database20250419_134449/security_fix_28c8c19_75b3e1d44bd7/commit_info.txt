Full commit message:
iwlwifi: mvm: don't wait for firmware verification

The firmware has a race in the flow that indicates the
completion of the authentication. Checking the completion
of the authentication is not really needed anyway since
we can wait for the ALIVE notification instead.
Remove the unneeded and buggy code.
