+Description:
+
+The CEC Framework allows for CEC error injection commands through
+debugfs. Drivers that support this will create an error-inj file
+through which the error injection commands can be given.
+
+The basic syntax is as follows:
+
+Leading spaces/tabs are ignored. If the next character is a '#' or the
+end of the line was reached, then the whole line is ignored. Otherwise
+a command is expected.
+
+It is up to the driver to decide what commands to implement. The only
+exception is that the command 'clear' without any arguments must be
+implemented and that it will remove all current error injection
+commands.
+
+This ensures that you can always do 'echo clear >error-inj' to clear any
+error injections without having to know the details of the driver-specific
+commands.
+
+Note that the output of 'error-inj' shall be valid as input to 'error-inj'.
+So this must work:
+
+	$ cat error-inj >einj.txt
+	$ cat einj.txt >error-inj
+
+Other than these basic rules described above this ABI is not considered
+stable and may change in the future.
+
+Drivers that implement this functionality must document the commands as
+part of the CEC documentation and must keep that documentation up to date
+when changes are made.
+
+The following CEC error injection implementations exist:
