    wifi: mac80211: fix MBSSID parsing use-after-free
    
    When we parse a multi-BSSID element, we might point some
    element pointers into the allocated nontransmitted_profile.
    However, we free this before returning, causing UAF when the
    relevant pointers in the parsed elements are accessed.
    
    Fix this by not allocating the scratch buffer separately but
    as part of the returned structure instead, that way, there
    are no lifetime issues with it.
    
    The scratch buffer introduction as part of the returned data
    here is taken from MLO feature work done by Ilan.
    
    This fixes CVE-2022-42719.
