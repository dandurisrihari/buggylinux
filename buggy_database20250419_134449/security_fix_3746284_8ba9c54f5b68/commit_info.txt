Full commit message:
ASoC: SOF: ipc4-topology: Use size_add() in call to struct_size()

If, for any reason, the open-coded arithmetic causes a wraparound,
the protection that `struct_size()` adds against potential integer
overflows is defeated. Fix this by hardening call to `struct_size()`
with `size_add()`.
