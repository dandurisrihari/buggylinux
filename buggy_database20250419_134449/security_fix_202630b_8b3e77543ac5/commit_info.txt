====================
pull request: wireless 2014-05-15

Please pull this batch of fixes for the 3.15 stream...

For the mac80211 bits, Johannes says:

"One fix is to get better VHT performance and the other fixes tracing
garbage or other potential issues with the interface name tracing."

And...

"This has a fix from Emmanuel for a problem I failed to fix - when
association is in progress then it needs to be cancelled while
suspending (I had fixed the same for authentication). Also included a
fix from myself for a userspace API problem that hit the iw tool and a
fix to the remain-on-channel framework."

For the iwlwifi bits, Emmanuel says:

"Alex fixes the scan by disabling the fragmented scan. David prevents
scan offload while associated, the firmware seems not to like it. I
fix a stupid bug I made in BT Coex, and fix a bad #ifdef clause in rate
scaling.  Along with that there is a fix for a NULL pointer exception
that can happen if we load the driver and our ISR gets called because
the interrupt line is shared. The fix has been tested by the reporter."

And...

"We have here a fix from David Spinadel that makes a previous fix more
complete, and an off-by-one issue fixed by Eliad in the same area.
I fix the monitor that broke on the way."

Beyond that...

Daniel Kim's one-liner fixes a brcmfmac regression caused by a typo
in an earlier commit..

Rajkumar Manoharan fixes an ath9k oops reported by David Herrmann.
