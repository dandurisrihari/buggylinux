Merge tag 'driver-core-5.18-rc1' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/driver-core

Pull driver core updates from Greg KH:
 "Here is the set of driver core changes for 5.18-rc1.

  Not much here, primarily it was a bunch of cleanups and small updates:

   - kobj_type cleanups for default_groups

   - documentation updates

   - firmware loader minor changes

   - component common helper added and take advantage of it in many
     drivers (the largest part of this pull request).

  All of these have been in linux-next for a while with no reported
  problems"
