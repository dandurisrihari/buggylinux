Full commit message:
scsi: qla2xxx: edif: Fix app start delay

Current driver does unnecessary pause for each session to get to certain
state before allowing the app start call to return. In larger environment,
this introduces a long delay.  Originally the delay was meant to
synchronize app and driver. However, the with current implementation the
two sides use various events to synchronize their state.

The same is applied to the authentication failure call.
