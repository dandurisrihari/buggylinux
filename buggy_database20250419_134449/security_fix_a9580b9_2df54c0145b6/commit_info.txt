Full commit message:
rpmsg: core: Replace deprecated strncpy with strscpy

strncpy() is deprecated for use on NUL-terminated destination strings
[1] and as such we should prefer more robust and less ambiguous string
interfaces.

We expect chinfo.name to be NUL-terminated based on its usage with
strncmp():

rpmsg_core.c:
389: if (strncmp(chinfo->name, rpdev->id.name, RPMSG_NAME_SIZE))

Moreover, NUL-padding is not required as chinfo has stack default
initialized all fields to zero:

rpmsg_core.c:
539: struct rpmsg_channel_info chinfo = {};

Considering the above, a suitable replacement is `strscpy` [2] due to
the fact that it guarantees NUL-termination on the destination buffer
without unnecessarily NUL-padding.

Also, favor the more idiomatic strscpy() usage of:
(dest, src, sizeof(dest)).
