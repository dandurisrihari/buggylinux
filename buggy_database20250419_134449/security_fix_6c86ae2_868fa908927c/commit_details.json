The user should not by default be\n  able to enable function tracing.\n\n  The fix is to use \"perf_paranoid_tracepoint_raw()\" which will not let\n  the user enable function tracing.  This is a security fix as normal\n  users should never be allowed to enable the function tracer\"\n\n* tag 'ftrace-urgent-3.12-v2' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/rostedt/linux-trace:\n  perf/ftrace: Fix paranoid level for enabling function tracer",
