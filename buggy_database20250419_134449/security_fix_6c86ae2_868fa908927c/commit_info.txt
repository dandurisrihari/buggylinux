Full commit message:
Merge tag 'ftrace-urgent-3.12-v2' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/rostedt/linux-trace

Pull perf/ftrace fix from Steven Rostedt:
 "Dave Jones's trinity program was able to enable the function tracer
  from a normal user account via the perf syscall "perf_event_open()".
  When I was able to reproduce it with trinity, I was able to track down
  exactly how it happened.

  I discovered that the check for whether the function tracepoint should
  be activated or not was using the "perf_paranoid_kernel()" check which
  by default, lets the user continue.  The user should not by default be
  able to enable function tracing.

  The fix is to use "perf_paranoid_tracepoint_raw()" which will not let
  the user enable function tracing.  This is a security fix as normal
  users should never be allowed to enable the function tracer"
