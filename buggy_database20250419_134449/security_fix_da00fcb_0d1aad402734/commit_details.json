  "body": "When injecting a floating interrupt and no CPU is idle we\nkick one CPU to do an external exit. In case of I/O we\nshould trigger an I/O exit instead. This does not matter\nfor Linux guests as external and I/O interrupts are\nenabled/disabled at the same time, but play safe anyway.\n\nThe same holds true for machine checks. Since there is no\nspecial exit, just reuse the generic stop exit. The injection\ncode inside the VCPU loop will recheck anyway and rearm the\nproper exits (e.g. control registers) if necessary.\n\nSigned-off-by: Christian Borntraeger <borntraeger@de.ibm.com>\nReviewed-by: Thomas Huth <thuth@linux.vnet.ibm.com>\nReviewed-by: David Hildenbrand <dahi@linux.vnet.ibm.com>",
