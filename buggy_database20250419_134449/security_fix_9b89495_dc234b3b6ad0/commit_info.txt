wifi: nl80211: Allow authentication frames and set keys on NAN interface

Wi-Fi Aware R4 specification defines NAN Pairing which uses PASN handshake
to authenticate the peer and generate keys. Hence allow to register and transmit
the PASN authentication frames on NAN interface and set the keys to driver or
underlying modules on NAN interface.

The driver needs to configure the feature flag NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_SECURE_NAN,
which also helps userspace modules to know if the driver supports secure NAN.
