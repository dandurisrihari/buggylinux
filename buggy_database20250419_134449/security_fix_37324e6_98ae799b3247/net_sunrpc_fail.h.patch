    SUNRPC: Cache deferral injection
    
    Cache deferral injection stress-tests the cache deferral logic as
    well as upper layer protocol deferred request handlers. This
    facility is for developers and professional testers to ensure
    coverage of the rqst deferral code paths. To date, we haven't
    had an adequate way to ensure these code paths are covered
    during testing, short of temporary code changes to force their
    use.
    
    A file called /sys/kernel/debug/fail_sunrpc/ignore-cache-wait
    enables administrators to disable cache deferral injection while
    allowing other types of sunrpc errors to be injected. The default
    setting is that cache deferral injection is enabled (ignore=false).
    
    To enable support for cache deferral injection,
    CONFIG_FAULT_INJECTION, CONFIG_FAULT_INJECTION_DEBUG_FS, and
    CONFIG_SUNRPC_DEBUG must all be set to "Y".
