Merge tag 'slab-for-6.6' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/vbabka/slab

Pull slab updates from Vlastimil Babka:
 "This happens to be a small one (due to summer I guess), and all
  hardening related:

   - Randomized kmalloc caches, by GONG, Ruiqi.

     A new opt-in hardening feature to make heap spraying harder. It
     creates multiple (16) copies of kmalloc caches, reducing the chance
     of an attacker-controllable allocation site to land in the same
     slab as e.g. an allocation site with use-after-free vulnerability.

     The selection of the copy is derived from the allocation site
     address, including a per-boot random seed.

   - Stronger typing for hardened freelists in SLUB, by Jann Horn

     Introduces a custom type for hardened freelist entries instead of
     "void *" as those are not directly dereferencable. While reviewing
     this, I've noticed opportunities for further cleanups in that code
     and added those on top"
