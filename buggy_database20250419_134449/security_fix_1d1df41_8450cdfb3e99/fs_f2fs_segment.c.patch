    Pull f2fs updates from Jaegeuk Kim:
     "In this round, we've tried to address some performance issues in
      f2fs_checkpoint and direct IO flows. Also, there was a work to enhance
      the page cache management used for compression. Other than them, we've
      done typical work including sysfs, code clean-ups, tracepoint, sanity
      check, in addition to bug fixes on corner cases.
    
      Enhancements:
       - use iomap for direct IO
       - try to avoid lock contention to improve f2fs_ckpt speed
       - avoid unnecessary memory allocation in compression flow
       - POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED drops the page cache containing compression
         pages
       - add some sysfs entries (gc_urgent_high_remaining, pending_discard)
    
      Bug fixes:
       - try not to expose unwritten blocks to user by DIO (this was added
         to avoid merge conflict; another patch is coming to address other
         missing case)
       - relax minor error condition for file pinning feature used in
         Android OTA
       - fix potential deadlock case in compression flow
       - should not truncate any block on pinned file
    
      In addition, we've done some code clean-ups and tracepoint/sanity
      check improvement"
