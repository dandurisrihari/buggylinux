Pull networking changes from David Miller:

1) Allow to dump, monitor, and change the bridge multicast database
   using netlink.  From Cong Wang.

2) RFC 5961 TCP blind data injection attack mitigation, from Eric
   Dumazet.

3) Networking user namespace support from Eric W. Biederman.

4) tuntap/virtio-net multiqueue support by Jason Wang.

5) Support for checksum offload of encapsulated packets (basically,
   tunneled traffic can still be checksummed by HW).  From Joseph
   Gasparakis.

6) Allow BPF filter access to VLAN tags, from Eric Dumazet and
   Daniel Borkmann.

7) Bridge port parameters over netlink and BPDU blocking support
   from Stephen Hemminger.

8) Improve data access patterns during inet socket demux by rearranging
   socket layout, from Eric Dumazet.

9) TIPC protocol updates and cleanups from Ying Xue, Paul Gortmaker, and
   Jon Maloy.

10) Update TCP socket hash sizing to be more in line with current day
    realities.  The existing heurstics were choosen a decade ago.
    From Eric Dumazet.

11) Fix races, queue bloat, and excessive wakeups in ATM and
    associated drivers, from Krzysztof Mazur and David Woodhouse.

12) Support DOVE (Distributed Overlay Virtual Ethernet) extensions
    in VXLAN driver, from David Stevens.

13) Add "oops_only" mode to netconsole, from Amerigo Wang.

14) Support set and query of VEB/VEPA bridge mode via PF_BRIDGE, also
    allow DCB netlink to work on namespaces other than the initial
    namespace.  From John Fastabend.

15) Support PTP in the Tigon3 driver, from Matt Carlson.

16) tun/vhost zero copy fixes and improvements, plus turn it on
    by default, from Michael S. Tsirkin.

17) Support per-association statistics in SCTP, from Michele
    Baldessari.

And many, many, driver updates, cleanups, and improvements.  Too
numerous to mention individually.
