Full commit message:
Merge tag 'media/v4.17-2' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mchehab/linux-media

Pull media fixes from Mauro Carvalho Chehab:
 "A series of media updates/fixes for 4.17.

  There are two important core fix patches in this series:

   - A regression fix on Kernel 4.16 with causes it to not work with
     some input devices that depend on media core

   - A fix at compat32 bits with causes it to OOPS on overlay, and
     affects the Kernels where the CVE-2017-13166 was backported

  The remaining ones are other random fixes at the documentation and on
  drivers.

  The biggest part of this series is a set of 18 patches for the Intel
  atomisp driver. Currently, it produces hundreds of warnings/errors on
  sparse/smatch, causing me to sometimes ignore new warnings on other
  drivers that are not so broken. This driver is on really poor state,
  even for staging standards: it has several layers of abstraction on
  it, and it supports two different hardware. Selecting between them
  require to add a define (there isn't even a Kconfig option for such
  purpose). Just on this smatch cleanup, I could easily get rid of 8
  "do-nothing" files. So, I'm seriously considering its removal from
  upstream, if I don't see any real work on addressing the problems
  there along this year"
