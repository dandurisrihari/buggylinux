Merge tag 'random_for_linus' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tytso/random

Pull /dev/random changes from Ted Ts'o:
 "The /dev/random changes for 3.13 including a number of improvements in
  the following areas: performance, avoiding waste of entropy, better
  tracking of entropy estimates, support for non-x86 platforms that have
  a register which can't be used for fine-grained timekeeping, but which
  might be good enough for the random driver.

  Also add some printk's so that we can see how quickly /dev/urandom can
  get initialized, and when programs try to use /dev/urandom before it
  is fully initialized (since this could be a security issue).  This
  shouldn't be an issue on x86 desktop/laptops --- a test on my Lenovo
  T430s laptop shows that /dev/urandom is getting fully initialized
  approximately two seconds before the root file system is mounted
  read/write --- this may be an issue with ARM and MIPS embedded/mobile
  systems, though.  These printk's will be a useful canary before
  potentially adding a future change to start blocking processes which
  try to read from /dev/urandom before it is initialized, which is
  something FreeBSD does already for security reasons, and which
  security folks have been agitating for Linux to also adopt"
