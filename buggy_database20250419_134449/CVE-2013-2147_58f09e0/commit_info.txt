CVE Identifiers:
- CVE-2013-2147

Full commit message:
cciss: fix info leak in cciss_ioctl32_passthru()

The arg64 struct has a hole after ->buf_size which isn't cleared.  Or if
any of the calls to copy_from_user() fail then that would cause an
information leak as well.

This was assigned CVE-2013-2147.
