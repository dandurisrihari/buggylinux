    Merge branch 'for-3.8' of git://linux-nfs.org/~bfields/linux
    
    Pull nfsd update from Bruce Fields:
     "Included this time:
    
       - more nfsd containerization work from Stanislav Kinsbursky: we're
         not quite there yet, but should be by 3.9.
    
       - NFSv4.1 progress: implementation of basic backchannel security
         negotiation and the mandatory BACKCHANNEL_CTL operation.  See
    
           http://wiki.linux-nfs.org/wiki/index.php/Server_4.0_and_4.1_issues
    
         for remaining TODO's
    
       - Fixes for some bugs that could be triggered by unusual compounds.
         Our xdr code wasn't designed with v4 compounds in mind, and it
         shows.  A more thorough rewrite is still a todo.
    
       - If you've ever seen "RPC: multiple fragments per record not
         supported" logged while using some sort of odd userland NFS client,
         that should now be fixed.
    
       - Further work from Jeff Layton on our mechanism for storing
         information about NFSv4 clients across reboots.
    
       - Further work from Bryan Schumaker on his fault-injection mechanism
         (which allows us to discard selective NFSv4 state, to excercise
         rarely-taken recovery code paths in the client.)
    
       - The usual mix of miscellaneous bugs and cleanup.
    
      Thanks to everyone who tested or contributed this cycle."
