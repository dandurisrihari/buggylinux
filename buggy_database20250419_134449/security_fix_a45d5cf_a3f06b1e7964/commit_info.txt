Full commit message:
accel/habanalabs: refactor deprecated strncpy to strscpy_pad

`strncpy` is deprecated for use on NUL-terminated destination strings [1].

We see that `prop->cpucp_info.card_name` is supposed to be
NUL-terminated based on its usage within `__hwmon_device_register()`
(wherein it's called "name"):
|	if (name && (!strlen(name) || strpbrk(name, "-* \t\n")))
|		dev_warn(dev,
|			 "hwmon: '%s' is not a valid name attribute, please fix\n",
|			 name);

A suitable replacement is `strscpy_pad` [2] due to the fact that it
guarantees both NUL-termination and NUL-padding on its destination
buffer.

NUL-padding on `prop->cpucp_info.card_name` is not strictly necessary as
`hdev->prop` is explicitly zero-initialized but should be used
regardless as it gets copied out to userspace directly -- as per Kees'
suggestion.
