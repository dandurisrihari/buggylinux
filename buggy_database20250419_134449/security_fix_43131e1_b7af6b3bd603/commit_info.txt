HWPOISON, hugetlb: support hwpoison injection for hugepage

This patch enables hwpoison injection through debug/hwpoison interfaces,
with which we can test memory error handling for free or reserved
hugepages (which cannot be tested by madvise() injector).

[AK: Export PageHuge too for the injection module]
