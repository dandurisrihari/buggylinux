    Merge tag 'pm-5.5-rc1' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/rafael/linux-pm
    
    Pull power management updates from Rafael Wysocki:
     "These include cpuidle changes to use nanoseconds (instead of
      microseconds) as the unit of time and to simplify checks for disabled
      idle states in the idle loop, some cpuidle fixes and governor updates,
      assorted cpufreq updates (driver updates mostly and a few core fixes
      and cleanups), devfreq updates (dominated by the tegra30 driver
      changes), new CPU IDs for the RAPL power capping driver, relatively
      minor updates of the generic power domains (genpd) and operation
      performance points (OPP) frameworks, and assorted fixes and cleanups.
    
      There are also two maintainer information updates: Chanwoo Choi will
      be maintaining the devfreq subsystem going forward and Todd Brandt is
      going to maintain the pm-graph utility (created by him).
    
      Specifics:
    
       - Use nanoseconds (instead of microseconds) as the unit of time in
         the cpuidle core and simplify checks for disabled idle states in
         the idle loop (Rafael Wysocki)
    
       - Fix and clean up the teo cpuidle governor (Rafael Wysocki)
    
       - Fix the cpuidle registration error code path (Zhenzhong Duan)
    
       - Avoid excessive vmexits in the ACPI cpuidle driver (Yin Fengwei)
    
       - Extend the idle injection infrastructure to be able to measure the
         requested duration in nanoseconds and to allow an exit latency
         limit for idle states to be specified (Daniel Lezcano)
    
       - Fix cpufreq driver registration and clarify a comment in the
         cpufreq core (Viresh Kumar)
    
       - Add NULL checks to the show() and store() methods of sysfs
         attributes exposed by cpufreq (Kai Shen)
    
       - Update cpufreq drivers:
          * Fix for a plain int as pointer warning from sparse in
            intel_pstate (Jamal Shareef)
          * Fix for a hardcoded number of CPUs and stack bloat in the
            powernv driver (John Hubbard)
          * Updates to the ti-cpufreq driver and DT files to support new
            platforms and migrate bindings from opp-v1 to opp-v2 (Adam Ford,
            H. Nikolaus Schaller)
          * Merging of the arm_big_little and vexpress-spc drivers and
            related cleanup (Sudeep Holla)
          * Fix for imx's default speed grade value (Anson Huang)
          * Minor cleanup of the s3c64xx driver (Nathan Chancellor)
          * CPU speed bin detection fix for sun50i (Ondrej Jirman)
    
       - Appoint Chanwoo Choi as the new devfreq maintainer.
    
       - Update the devfreq core:
          * Check NULL governor in available_governors_show sysfs to prevent
            showing wrong governor information and fix a race condition
            between devfreq_update_status() and trans_stat_show() (Leonard
            Crestez)
          * Add new 'interrupt-driven' flag for devfreq governors to allow
            interrupt-driven governors to prevent the devfreq core from
            polling devices for status (Dmitry Osipenko)
          * Improve an error message in devfreq_add_device() (Matthias
            Kaehlcke)
    
       - Update devfreq drivers:
          * tegra30 driver fixes and cleanups (Dmitry Osipenko)
          * Removal of unused property from dt-binding documentation for the
            exynos-bus driver (Kamil Konieczny)
          * exynos-ppmu cleanup and DT bindings update (Lukasz Luba, Marek
            Szyprowski)
    
       - Add new CPU IDs for CometLake Mobile and Desktop to the Intel RAPL
         power capping driver (Zhang Rui)
    
       - Allow device initialization in the generic power domains (genpd)
         framework to be more straightforward and clean it up (Ulf Hansson)
    
       - Add support for adjusting OPP voltages at run time to the OPP
         framework (Stephen Boyd)
    
       - Avoid freeing memory that has never been allocated in the
         hibernation core (Andy Whitcroft)
    
       - Clean up function headers in a header file and coding style in the
         wakeup IRQs handling code (Ulf Hansson, Xiaofei Tan)
    
       - Clean up the SmartReflex adaptive voltage scaling (AVS) driver for
         ARM (Ben Dooks, Geert Uytterhoeven)
    
       - Wrap power management documentation to fit in 80 columns (Bjorn
         Helgaas)
    
       - Add pm-graph utility entry to MAINTAINERS (Todd Brandt)
    
       - Update the cpupower utility:
          * Fix the handling of set and info subcommands (Abhishek Goel)
          * Fix build warnings (Nathan Chancellor)
          * Improve mperf_monitor handling (Janakarajan Natarajan)"
