Full commit message:
KVM: s390: instruction-fetching exceptions on SIE faults

On instruction-fetch exceptions, we have to forward the PSW by any
valid ilc and correctly use that ilc when injecting the irq. Injection
will already take care of rewinding the PSW if we injected a nullifying
program irq, so we don't need special handling prior to injection.

Until now, autodetection would have guessed an ilc of 0.
