  "body": "This patch fixes a particular type of data corruption that has been\nencountered when loading a snapshot's metadata from disk.\n\nWhen we allocate a new chunk in persistent_prepare, we increment\nps->next_free and we make sure that it doesn't point to a metadata area\nby further incrementing it if necessary.\n\nWhen we load metadata from disk on device activation, ps->next_free is\npositioned after the last used data chunk. However, if this last used\ndata chunk is followed by a metadata area, ps->next_free is positioned\nerroneously to the metadata area. A newly-allocated chunk is placed at\nthe same location as the metadata area, resulting in data or metadata\ncorruption.\n\nThis patch changes the code so that ps->next_free skips the metadata\narea when metadata are loaded in function read_exceptions.\n\nThe patch also moves a piece of code from persistent_prepare_exception\nto a separate function skip_metadata to avoid code duplication.\n\nCVE-2013-4299\n\nSigned-off-by: Mikulas Patocka <mpatocka@redhat.com>\nCc: stable@vger.kernel.org\nCc: Mike Snitzer <snitzer@redhat.com>\nSigned-off-by: Alasdair G Kergon <agk@redhat.com>",
