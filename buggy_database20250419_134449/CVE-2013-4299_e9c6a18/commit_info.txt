Full commit message:
dm snapshot: fix data corruption

This patch fixes a particular type of data corruption that has been
encountered when loading a snapshot's metadata from disk.

When we allocate a new chunk in persistent_prepare, we increment
ps->next_free and we make sure that it doesn't point to a metadata area
by further incrementing it if necessary.

When we load metadata from disk on device activation, ps->next_free is
positioned after the last used data chunk. However, if this last used
data chunk is followed by a metadata area, ps->next_free is positioned
erroneously to the metadata area. A newly-allocated chunk is placed at
the same location as the metadata area, resulting in data or metadata
corruption.

This patch changes the code so that ps->next_free skips the metadata
area when metadata are loaded in function read_exceptions.

The patch also moves a piece of code from persistent_prepare_exception
to a separate function skip_metadata to avoid code duplication.
