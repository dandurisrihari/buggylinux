Full commit message:
tracing/branch-profiler: Replace deprecated strncpy with strscpy

strncpy() is deprecated for use on NUL-terminated destination strings
[1] and as such we should prefer more robust and less ambiguous string
interfaces.

Both of these fields want to be NUL-terminated as per their use in
printk:

    F_printk("%u:%s:%s (%u)%s",
      __entry->line,
      __entry->func, __entry->file, __entry->correct,
      __entry->constant ? " CONSTANT" : "")

Use strscpy() as it NUL-terminates the destination buffer, so it doesn't
have to be done manually.
