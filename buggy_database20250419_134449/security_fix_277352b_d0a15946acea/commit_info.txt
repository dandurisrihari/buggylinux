Full commit message:
f2fs: consolidate unsupported option handling errors

When certain build-time options are disabled, some mount options are not
accepted. For quota and compression, all related options are dismissed
with a single error message. For xattr, acl, and fault injection, each
option is handled individually. In addition, inline_xattr_size was missed
when CONFIG_F2FS_FS_XATTR was disabled.

Collapse xattr, acl, and fault injection errors into a single string, for
simplicity, and handle the missing inline_xattr_size case.
