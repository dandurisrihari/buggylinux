[PATCH] make cap_ptrace enforce PTRACE_TRACME checks

PTRACE_TRACEME doesn't have proper capabilities validation when parent is
less privileged than child.  Issue pointed out by Ram Gupta
<ram.gupta5@gmail.com>.

Note: I haven't identified a strong security issue, and it's a small ABI
change that could break apps that rely on existing behaviour (which allows
parent that is less privileged than child to ptrace when child does
PTRACE_TRACEME).
