Merge tag 'gpio-v5.3-1' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/linusw/linux-gpio

Pull GPIO updates from Linus Walleij:
 "This is the big slew of GPIO changes for the v5.3 kernel cycle. This
  is mostly incremental work this time.

  Three important things:

   - The FMC subsystem is deleted through my tree. This happens through
     GPIO as its demise was discussed in relation to a patch decoupling
     its GPIO implementation from the standard way of handling GPIO. As
     it turns out, that is not the only subsystem it reimplements and
     the authors think it is better do scratch it and start over using
     the proper kernel subsystems than try to polish the rust shiny. See
     the commit (ACKed by the maintainers) for details.

   - Arnd made a small devres patch that was ACKed by Greg and goes into
     the device core.

   - SPDX header change colissions may happen, because at times I've
     seen that quite a lot changed during the -rc:s in regards to SPDX.
     (It is good stuff, tglx has me convinced, and it is worth the
     occasional pain.)

  Apart from this is is nothing controversial or problematic.

  Summary:

  Core:

   - When a gpio_chip request GPIOs from itself, it can now fully
     control the line characteristics, both machine and consumer flags.
     This makes a lot of sense, but took some time before I figured out
     that this is how it has to work.

   - Several smallish documentation fixes.

  New drivers:

   - The PCA953x driver now supports the TI TCA9539.

   - The DaVinci driver now supports the K3 AM654 SoCs.

  Driver improvements:

   - Major overhaul and hardening of the OMAP driver by Russell King.

   - Starting to move some drivers to the new API passing irq_chip along
     with the gpio_chip when adding the gpio_chip instead of adding it
     separately.

  Unrelated:

   - Delete the FMC subsystem"
