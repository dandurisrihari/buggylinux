Full commit message:
mmc: core: add random fault injection

This adds support to inject data errors after a completed host transfer.
The mmc core will return error even though the host transfer is successful.
This simple fault injection proved to be very useful to test the
non-blocking error handling in the mmc_blk_issue_rw_rq().
Random faults can also test how the host driver handles pre_req()
and post_req() in case of errors.
