Full commit message:
mfd: db8500-prcmu: Replace deprecated strncpy with strscpy

`strncpy` is deprecated for use on NUL-terminated destination strings
[1] and as such we should prefer more robust and less ambiguous string
interfaces.

We expect project_name to be NUL-terminated based on its use with
pr_info:
| 	pr_info("PRCMU firmware: %s(%d), version %d.%d.%d\n",
| 		fw_info.version.project_name,
| 		fw_info.version.project,
| 		fw_info.version.api_version,
| 		fw_info.version.func_version,
| 		fw_info.version.errata);

Moreover, NUL-padding does not seem to be needed.

Considering the above, a suitable replacement is `strscpy` [2] due to
the fact that it guarantees NUL-termination on the destination buffer
without unnecessarily NUL-padding.

Let's also change `PRCMU_FW_PROJECT_NAME_LEN` to just
sizeof(fw_info.version.project_name) as this is more idiomatic strscpy
usage.
