  "body": "The VSC7514 is marketed as a 10-port switch, however it has 11 physical\nports (0->10) in the block diagram:\nhttps://www.microsemi.com/product-directory/ethernet-switches/3992-vsc7514\n(also in the device tree at arch/mips/boot/dts/mscc/ocelot.dtsi)\n\nAdditionally, by architecture it has one more entry in the analyzer\nblock, situated right after the physical ports, for the CPU port module.\nThis is not a physical port, it only represents a channel for frame\ninjection and extraction. That entry for the CPU port is at index 11 in\nthe analyzer.\n\nWhen the register groups for QSYS_SWITCH_PORT_MODE, SYS_PORT_MODE and\nSYS_PAUSE_CFG are declared to be replicated 11 times, the 11th entry in\nthe array of regfields is not initialized, so the CPU port module is not\ninitialized either.\n\nThe documentation of QSYS_SWITCH_PORT_MODE for VSC7514 also says that\nthis register group is replicated 12 times, so this patch is simply\nreflecting that and not introducing any further inconsistency.\n\nFixes: 886e1387c73d (\"net: mscc: ocelot: convert QSYS_SWITCH_PORT_MODE and SYS_PORT_MODE to regfields\")\nFixes: 541132f0961a (\"net: mscc: ocelot: convert SYS_PAUSE_CFG register access to regfield\")\nReported-by: Bryan Whitehead <bryan.whitehead@microchip.com>\nSigned-off-by: Vladimir Oltean <vladimir.oltean@nxp.com>\nSigned-off-by: David S.
