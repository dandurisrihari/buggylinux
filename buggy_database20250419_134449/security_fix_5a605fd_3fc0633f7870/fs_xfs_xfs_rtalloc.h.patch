    xfs: recalculate free rt extents after log recovery
    
    I've been observing periodic corruption reports from xfs_scrub involving
    the free rt extent counter (frextents) while running xfs/141.  That test
    uses an error injection knob to induce a torn write to the log, and an
    arbitrary number of recovery mounts, frextents will count fewer free rt
    extents than can be found the rtbitmap.
    
    The root cause of the problem is a combination of the misuse of
    sb_frextents in the incore mount to reflect both incore reservations
    made by running transactions as well as the actual count of free rt
    extents on disk.  The following sequence can reproduce the undercount:
    
    Thread 1                        Thread 2
    xfs_trans_alloc(rtextents=3)
    xfs_mod_frextents(-3)
    <blocks>
                                    xfs_attr_set()
                                    xfs_bmap_attr_addfork()
                                    xfs_add_attr2()
                                    xfs_log_sb()
                                    xfs_sb_to_disk()
                                    xfs_trans_commit()
    <log flushed to disk>
    <log goes down>
    
    Note that thread 1 subtracts 3 from sb_frextents even though it never
    commits to using that space.  Thread 2 writes the undercounted value to
    the ondisk superblock and logs it to the xattr transaction, which is
    then flushed to disk.  At next mount, log recovery will find the logged
    superblock and write that back into the filesystem.  At the end of log
    recovery, we reread the superblock and install the recovered
    undercounted frextents value into the incore superblock.  From that
    point on, we've effectively leaked thread 1's transaction reservation.
    
    The correct fix for this is to separate the incore reservation from the
    ondisk usage, but that's a matter for the next patch.  Because the
    kernel has been logging superblocks with undercounted frextents for a
    very long time and we don't demand that sysadmins run xfs_repair after a
    crash, fix the undercount by recomputing frextents after log recovery.
    
    Gating this on log recovery is a reasonable balance (I think) between
    correcting the problem and slowing down every mount attempt.  Note that
    xfs_repair will fix undercounted frextents.
