Full commit message:
[CIFS] default ntlmv2 for cifs mount delayed to 3.3

Turned out the ntlmv2 (default security authentication)
upgrade was harder to test than expected, and we ran
out of time to test against Apple and a few other servers
that we wanted to.  Delay upgrade of default security
from ntlm to ntlmv2 (on mount) to 3.3.  Still works
fine to specify it explicitly via "sec=ntlmv2" so this
should be fine.
