@@@ -425,47 -444,3 +425,37 @@@ What:	CONFIG_RFKILL_INPU
  When:	2.6.33
  Why:	Should be implemented in userspace, policy daemon.

- What:	CONFIG_X86_OLD_MCE
- When:	2.6.32
- Why:	Remove the old legacy 32bit machine check code. This has been
- 	superseded by the newer machine check code from the 64bit port,
- 	but the old version has been kept around for easier testing. Note this
- 	doesn't impact the old P5 and WinChip machine check handlers.

- ----------------------------
- 
 +What:	lock_policy_rwsem_* and unlock_policy_rwsem_* will not be
 +	exported interface anymore.
 +When:	2.6.33
 +Why:	cpu_policy_rwsem has a new cleaner definition making it local to
 +	cpufreq core and contained inside cpufreq.c. Other dependent
 +	drivers should not use it in order to safely avoid lockdep issues.
 +Who:	Venkatesh Pallipadi <venkatesh.pallipadi@intel.com>
 +
 +----------------------------
 +
 +What:	sound-slot/service-* module aliases and related clutters in
 +	sound/sound_core.c
 +When:	August 2010
 +Why:	OSS sound_core grabs all legacy minors (0-255) of SOUND_MAJOR
 +	(14) and requests modules using custom sound-slot/service-*
 +	module aliases.  The only benefit of doing this is allowing
 +	use of custom module aliases which might as well be considered
 +	a bug at this point.  This preemptive claiming prevents
 +	alternative OSS implementations.
 +
 +	Till the feature is removed, the kernel will be requesting
 +	both sound-slot/service-* and the standard char-major-* module
 +	aliases and allow turning off the pre-claiming selectively via
 +	CONFIG_SOUND_OSS_CORE_PRECLAIM and soundcore.preclaim_oss
 +	kernel parameter.
 +
 +	After the transition phase is complete, both the custom module
 +	aliases and switches to disable it will go away.  This removal
 +	will also allow making ALSA OSS emulation independent of
 +	sound_core.  The dependency will be broken then too.
