Full commit message:
futex: Fix incorrect should_fail_futex() handling

If should_futex_fail() returns true in futex_wake_pi(), then the 'ret'
variable is set to -EFAULT and then immediately overwritten. So the failure
injection is non-functional.

Fix it by actually leaving the function and returning -EFAULT.

The Fixes tag is kinda blury because the initial commit which introduced
failure injection was already sloppy, but the below mentioned commit broke
it completely.
