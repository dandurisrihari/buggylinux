  "body": "strncpy() is deprecated for use on NUL-terminated destination strings\n[1] and as such we should prefer more robust and less ambiguous string\ninterfaces.\n\nWe expect led->name to be NUL-terminated based on the presence of a\nmanual NUL-byte assignment.\n\nThis NUL-byte assignment was added in Commit daf9669bea30aa22 (\"ath5k:\nensure led name is null terminated\"). If strscpy() had existed and had\nbeen used back when this code was written then potential bugs and the\nneed to manually NUL-terminate could have been avoided. Since we now\nhave the technology, let's use it :)\n\nConsidering the above, a suitable replacement is `strscpy` [2] due to\nthe fact that it guarantees NUL-termination on the destination buffer\nwithout unnecessarily NUL-padding. If NUL-padding is required let's opt\nfor strscpy_pad().\n\nLink: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#strncpy-on-nul-terminated-strings [1]\nLink: https://manpages.debian.org/testing/linux-manual-4.8/strscpy.9.en.html [2]\nLink: https://github.com/KSPP/linux/issues/90\nCc: linux-hardening@vger.kernel.org\nSigned-off-by: Justin Stitt <justinstitt@google.com>\nSigned-off-by: Kalle Valo <quic_kvalo@quicinc.com>\nLink: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20231013-strncpy-drivers-net-wireless-ath-ath5k-led-c-v1-1-3acb0b5a21f2@google.com",
