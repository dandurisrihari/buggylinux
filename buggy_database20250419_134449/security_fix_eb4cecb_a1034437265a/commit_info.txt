Full commit message:
Revert "virtio_pci: harden MSI-X interrupts"

This reverts commit 9e35276a5344f74d4a3600fc4100b3dd251d5c56. Issue
were reported for the drivers that are using affinity managed IRQ
where manually toggling IRQ status is not expected. And we forget to
enable the interrupts in the restore path as well.

In the future, we will rework on the interrupt hardening.
