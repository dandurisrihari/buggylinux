Full commit message:
x86/cpu: Add CPU type to struct cpuinfo_topology

Sometimes it is required to take actions based on if a CPU is a performance or
efficiency core. As an example, intel_pstate driver uses the Intel core-type
to determine CPU scaling. Also, some CPU vulnerabilities only affect
a specific CPU type, like RFDS only affects Intel Atom. Hybrid systems that
have variants P+E, P-only(Core) and E-only(Atom), it is not straightforward to
identify which variant is affected by a type specific vulnerability.

Such processors do have CPUID field that can uniquely identify them. Like,
P+E, P-only and E-only enumerates CPUID.1A.CORE_TYPE identification, while P+E
additionally enumerates CPUID.7.HYBRID. Based on this information, it is
possible for boot CPU to identify if a system has mixed CPU types.

Add a new field hw_cpu_type to struct cpuinfo_topology that stores the
hardware specific CPU type. This saves the overhead of IPIs to get the CPU
type of a different CPU. CPU type is populated early in the boot process,
before vulnerabilities are enumerated.
