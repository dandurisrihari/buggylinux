    riscv: Add ghostwrite vulnerability
    
    Follow the patterns of the other architectures that use
    GENERIC_CPU_VULNERABILITIES for riscv to introduce the ghostwrite
    vulnerability and mitigation. The mitigation is to disable all vector
    which is accomplished by clearing the bit from the cpufeature field.
    
    Ghostwrite only affects thead c9xx CPUs that impelment xtheadvector, so
    the vulerability will only be mitigated on these CPUs.
