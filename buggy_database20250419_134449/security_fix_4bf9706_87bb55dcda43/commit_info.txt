Full commit message:
riscv: Add ghostwrite vulnerability

Follow the patterns of the other architectures that use
GENERIC_CPU_VULNERABILITIES for riscv to introduce the ghostwrite
vulnerability and mitigation. The mitigation is to disable all vector
which is accomplished by clearing the bit from the cpufeature field.

Ghostwrite only affects thead c9xx CPUs that impelment xtheadvector, so
the vulerability will only be mitigated on these CPUs.
