But\nwhat might be more useful is showing all the slot status flags.\n\nAlso, this trace point can record and report the slot's index\nnumber, which among other things is useful for troubleshooting slot\ntable expansion and contraction.\n\nReviewed-by: Jeff Layton <jlayton@kernel.org>\nSigned-off-by: Chuck Lever <chuck.lever@oracle.com>",
