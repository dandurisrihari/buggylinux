John W. Linville says:

====================
A few more late-breaking fixes hoping for 3.10...

Regarding the Bluetooth fix, Gustavo says:

"A important fix to 3.10, this patch fixes an issues that was preventing
the l2cap info response command to be handled properly."

Also for that Bluetooth fix, Johan adds:

"Once the code gives up parsing this PDU it also gives up essential
parts of the L2CAP connection creation process, i.e. without this
patch the stack will fail to establish connections properly."

Moving onto ath9k, Felix Fietkau fixes an RCU locking issue in
the transmit path.  As for ath9k_htc, Sujith Manoharan fixes some
authentication timeouts by ensuring that a chip reset is done when
IDLE is turned off.

I think these are all micro-fixes that shouldn't cause any trouble.
Please let me know if there are problems!
