Then fill it with pointers to your\nfunction.  Then do read from file you've opened and if you are lucky,\nyou'll get it called as ->proc_handler() in kernel mode.\n\nSo this is at least an Oops and possibly more.  It does depend on an\ninterface going away though, so less of a security risk than it would\notherwise be.\n\nSigned-off-by: Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@suse.de>\nSigned-off-by: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@osdl.org>",
