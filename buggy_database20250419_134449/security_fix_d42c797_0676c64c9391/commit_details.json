This could result to delays\nin interrupt deliveries or even loss of interrupts.\nTo guarantee prompt interrupt injection, here we have to try to\nkick the VCPU.\n\nSigned-off-by: Shih-Wei Li <shihwei@cs.columbia.edu>\nReviewed-by: Christoffer Dall <christoffer.dall@linaro.org>\nSigned-off-by: Marc Zyngier <marc.zyngier@arm.com>",
