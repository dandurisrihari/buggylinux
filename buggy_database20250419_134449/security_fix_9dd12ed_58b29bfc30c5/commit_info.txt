Full commit message:
pstore/blk: replace deprecated strncpy with strscpy

strncpy() is deprecated for use on NUL-terminated destination strings
[1] and as such we should prefer more robust and less ambiguous string
interfaces.

We know that info-device should be NUL-terminated based on its use with
strlen():
|	static int __init mtdpstore_init(void)
|	{
|		int ret;
|		struct mtdpstore_context *cxt = &oops_cxt;
|		struct pstore_blk_config *info = &cxt->info;
|
|		ret = pstore_blk_get_config(info);
|		if (unlikely(ret))
|			return ret;
|
|		if (strlen(info->device) == 0) {
|			pr_err("mtd device must be supplied (device name is empty)\n");
...

Considering the above, a suitable replacement is `strscpy` [2] due to
the fact that it guarantees NUL-termination on the destination buffer.

Note that this patch relies on the _new_ 2-argument version of strscpy()
introduced in Commit e6584c3964f2f ("string: Allow 2-argument strscpy()").
