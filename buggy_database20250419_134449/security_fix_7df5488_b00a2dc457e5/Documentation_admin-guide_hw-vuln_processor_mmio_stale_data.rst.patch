    x86/bugs: Add "unknown" reporting for MMIO Stale Data
    
    Older Intel CPUs that are not in the affected processor list for MMIO
    Stale Data vulnerabilities currently report "Not affected" in sysfs,
    which may not be correct. Vulnerability status for these older CPUs is
    unknown.
    
    Add known-not-affected CPUs to the whitelist. Report "unknown"
    mitigation status for CPUs that are not in blacklist, whitelist and also
    don't enumerate MSR ARCH_CAPABILITIES bits that reflect hardware
    immunity to MMIO Stale Data vulnerabilities.
    
    Mitigation is not deployed when the status is unknown.
