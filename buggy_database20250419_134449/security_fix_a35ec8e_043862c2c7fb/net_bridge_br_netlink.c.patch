    bridge: Add MAC Authentication Bypass (MAB) support
    
    Hosts that support 802.1X authentication are able to authenticate
    themselves by exchanging EAPOL frames with an authenticator (Ethernet
    bridge, in this case) and an authentication server. Access to the
    network is only granted by the authenticator to successfully
    authenticated hosts.
    
    The above is implemented in the bridge using the "locked" bridge port
    option. When enabled, link-local frames (e.g., EAPOL) can be locally
    received by the bridge, but all other frames are dropped unless the host
    is authenticated. That is, unless the user space control plane installed
    an FDB entry according to which the source address of the frame is
    located behind the locked ingress port. The entry can be dynamic, in
    which case learning needs to be enabled so that the entry will be
    refreshed by incoming traffic.
    
    There are deployments in which not all the devices connected to the
    authenticator (the bridge) support 802.1X. Such devices can include
    printers and cameras. One option to support such deployments is to
    unlock the bridge ports connecting these devices, but a slightly more
    secure option is to use MAB. When MAB is enabled, the MAC address of the
    connected device is used as the user name and password for the
    authentication.
    
    For MAB to work, the user space control plane needs to be notified about
    MAC addresses that are trying to gain access so that they will be
    compared against an allow list. This can be implemented via the regular
    learning process with the sole difference that learned FDB entries are
    installed with a new "locked" flag indicating that the entry cannot be
    used to authenticate the device. The flag cannot be set by user space,
    but user space can clear the flag by replacing the entry, thereby
    authenticating the device.
    
    Locked FDB entries implement the following semantics with regards to
    roaming, aging and forwarding:
    
    1. Roaming: Locked FDB entries can roam to unlocked (authorized) ports,
       in which case the "locked" flag is cleared. FDB entries cannot roam
       to locked ports regardless of MAB being enabled or not. Therefore,
       locked FDB entries are only created if an FDB entry with the given {MAC,
       VID} does not already exist. This behavior prevents unauthenticated
       devices from disrupting traffic destined to already authenticated
       devices.
    
    2. Aging: Locked FDB entries age and refresh by incoming traffic like
       regular entries.
    
    3. Forwarding: Locked FDB entries forward traffic like regular entries.
       If user space detects an unauthorized MAC behind a locked port and
       wishes to prevent traffic with this MAC DA from reaching the host, it
       can do so using tc or a different mechanism.
    
    Enable the above behavior using a new bridge port option called "mab".
    It can only be enabled on a bridge port that is both locked and has
    learning enabled. Locked FDB entries are flushed from the port once MAB
    is disabled. A new option is added because there are pure 802.1X
    deployments that are not interested in notifications about locked FDB
    entries.
