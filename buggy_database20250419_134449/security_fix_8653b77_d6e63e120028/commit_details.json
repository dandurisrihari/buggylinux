  "body": "Pull clk updates from Stephen Boyd:\n \"The core framework got some nice improvements this time around. We\n  gained the ability to get struct clk pointers from a struct clk_hw so\n  that clk providers can consume the clks they provide, if they need to\n  do something like that. This has been a long missing part of the clk\n  provider API that will help us move away from exposing a struct clk\n  pointer in the struct clk_hw. Tracepoints are added for the\n  clk_set_rate() \"range\" functions, similar to the tracepoints we\n  already have for clk_set_rate() and we added a column to debugfs to\n  help developers understand the hardware enable state of clks in case\n  firmware or bootloader state is different than what is expected.\n  Overall the core changes are mostly improving the clk driver writing\n  experience.\n\n  At the driver level, we have the usual collection of driver updates\n  and new drivers for new SoCs.
