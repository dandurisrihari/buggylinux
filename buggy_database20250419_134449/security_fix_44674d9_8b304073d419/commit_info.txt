Full commit message:
mac80211: advertise support for full station state in AP mode

This enables adding stations in unauthenticated mode, just after
receiving the first authentication frame; which in turn allows
sending a negative authentication reply if the station cannot be
added.

In addition init rate control for unassociated station only when
it becomes associated, prior to that low rates will be used.
