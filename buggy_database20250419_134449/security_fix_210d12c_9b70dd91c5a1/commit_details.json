  "body": "It may be that the offset of the first program header lies inside the mdt's\nfilesize, in this case the loader would incorrectly assume that the bins\nwere not split and in this scenario the firmware authentication fails.\nThis change updates the logic used by the mdt loader to understand whether\nthe firmware images are split or not. It figures this out by checking if\neach programs header's segment lies within the file or not.\n\nCo-developed-by: Melody Olvera <quic_molvera@quicinc.com>\nSigned-off-by: Melody Olvera <quic_molvera@quicinc.com>\nSigned-off-by: Gokul krishna Krishnakumar <quic_gokukris@quicinc.com>\nSigned-off-by: Bjorn Andersson <andersson@kernel.org>\nLink: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20230509001821.24010-1-quic_gokukris@quicinc.com",
