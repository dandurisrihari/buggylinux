Full commit message:
power: supply: bq24190_charger: replace deprecated strncpy with strscpy

strncpy() is deprecated for use on NUL-terminated destination strings
[1] and as such we should prefer more robust and less ambiguous string
interfaces.

We expect bdi->model_name to be NUL-terminated based on its usage with
sysfs_emit and format strings:

val->strval is assigned to bdi->model_name in
bq24190_charger_get_property():
1186 | val->strval = bdi->model_name;

... then in power_supply_sysfs.c we use value.strval with a format string:
311  | ret = sysfs_emit(buf, "%s\n", value.strval);

we assigned value.strval via:
285  | ret = power_supply_get_property(psy, psp, &value);
... which invokes psy->desc->get_property():
1210 | return psy->desc->get_property(psy, psp, val);

with bq24190_charger_get_property():
1320 | static const struct power_supply_desc bq24190_charger_desc = {
...
1325 | 	.get_property		= bq24190_charger_get_property,

Moreover, no NUL-padding is required as bdi is zero-allocated in
bq24190_charger.c:
1798 | bdi = devm_kzalloc(dev, sizeof(*bdi), GFP_KERNEL);

Considering the above, a suitable replacement is `strscpy` [2] due to
the fact that it guarantees NUL-termination on the destination buffer
without unnecessarily NUL-padding.
