Merge branch 'for-next' of git://git.samba.org/sfrench/cifs-2.6

Pull cifs fixes from Steve French:
 "Including:

   - nine bug fixes for stable. Some of these we found at the recent two
     weeks of SMB3 test events/plugfests.

   - significant improvements in reconnection (e.g. if server or network
     crashes) especially when mounted with "persistenthandles" or to
     server which advertises Continuous Availability on the share.

   - a new mount option "idsfromsid" which improves POSIX compatibility
     in some cases (when winbind not configured e.g.) by better (and
     faster) fetching uid/gid from acl (when "cifsacl" mount option is
     enabled). NB: we are almost complete work on "cifsacl" (querying
     mode/uid/gid from ACL) for SMB3, but SMB3 support for cifsacl is
     not included in this set.

   - improved handling for SMB3 "credits" (even if server is buggy)

  Still working on two sets of changes:

   - cifsacl enablement for SMB3

   - cleanup of RFC1001 length calculation (so we can handle encryption
     and multichannel and RDMA)

  And a couple of new bugs were reported recently (unrelated to above)
  so will probably have another merge request next week"
