  "subject": "iwl3945: do not delay hardware scan if it is a direct scan",
  "body": "iwl3945 <---> mac80211 <----> wpa_supplicant <---> NetworkManager\n\nWhen a hardware scan is completed and another scan is requested in less\nthan two seconds, iwlwifi will not do the second scan and will pass the\nerror code -EAGAIN back to mac80211 where it quickly dies. The error\ncode is not passed along to the calling program wpa_supplicant. After a\ntimeout, wpa_supplicant will just give up but it will not know why the\nscan failed. This is a weakness in the design.\n\nI ran into this issue when I was trying to figure out why it takes more\nan a minute for NetworkManager to connect after Networking has been\ndisabled and then re-enabled. I found a good deal of unnecessary work\nbeing done because mac80211 requests authentication when the interface\nis not configured, the ANY mode. I created an experimental passive\n(NOTANY) mode for mac80211 to eliminate this case. Then NetworkManager\nbecame so fast that I ran into the iwlwifi 2 second delay next scan\nissue which we are discussing.\n\nThe patch resolves the problem by bypassing the delay if the scan request\nis a direct scan. It should do less harm to the hardware.\n\nSigned-off-by: Bill Moss <bmoss@CLEMSON.EDU>\nSigned-off-by: Zhu Yi <yi.zhu@intel.com>\nSigned-off-by: John W. Linville <linville@tuxdriver.com>",
