    Pull ARM virtualization changes:
     "This contains parts of the ARM KVM support that have dependencies on
      other patches merged through the arm-soc tree.  In combination with
      patches coming through Russell's tree, this will finally add full
      support for the kernel based virtual machine on ARM, which has been
      awaited for some time now.
    
      Further, we now have a separate platform for virtual machines and qemu
      booting that is used by both Xen and KVM, separating these from the
      Versatile Express reference implementation.  Obviously, this new
      platform is multiplatform capable so it can be combined with existing
      machines in the same kernel."
