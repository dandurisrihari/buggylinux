Full commit message:
mac80211: set basic rates earlier

The authentication and association handshake
already happens in the context of the new BSS,
and the basic rates are needed at least for
the ACK response frame to the authentication
or association response frames. Therefore the
basic rates should already be configured into
the driver when those frames are sent.

Change the logic to set up the basic rates in
the connection preparation that happens for
authentication and association (if needed).
