    Pull libnvdimm and dax updates from Dan Williams:
     "Save for a few late fixes, all of these commits have shipped in -next
      releases since before the merge window opened, and 0day has given a
      build success notification.
    
      The ext4 touches came from Jan, and the xfs touches have Darrick's
      reviewed-by. An xfstest for the MAP_SYNC feature has been through
      a few round of reviews and is on track to be merged.
    
       - Introduce MAP_SYNC and MAP_SHARED_VALIDATE, a mechanism to enable
         'userspace flush' of persistent memory updates via filesystem-dax
         mappings. It arranges for any filesystem metadata updates that may
         be required to satisfy a write fault to also be flushed ("on disk")
         before the kernel returns to userspace from the fault handler.
         Effectively every write-fault that dirties metadata completes an
         fsync() before returning from the fault handler. The new
         MAP_SHARED_VALIDATE mapping type guarantees that the MAP_SYNC flag
         is validated as supported by the filesystem's ->mmap() file
         operation.
    
       - Add support for the standard ACPI 6.2 label access methods that
         replace the NVDIMM_FAMILY_INTEL (vendor specific) label methods.
         This enables interoperability with environments that only implement
         the standardized methods.
    
       - Add support for the ACPI 6.2 NVDIMM media error injection methods.
    
       - Add support for the NVDIMM_FAMILY_INTEL v1.6 DIMM commands for
         latch last shutdown status, firmware update, SMART error injection,
         and SMART alarm threshold control.
    
       - Cleanup physical address information disclosures to be root-only.
    
       - Fix revalidation of the DIMM "locked label area" status to support
         dynamic unlock of the label area.
    
       - Expand unit test infrastructure to mock the ACPI 6.2 Translate SPA
         (system-physical-address) command and error injection commands.
