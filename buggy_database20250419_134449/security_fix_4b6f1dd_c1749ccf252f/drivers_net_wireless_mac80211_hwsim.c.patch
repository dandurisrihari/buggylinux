    mac80211: add explicit monitor interface if needed
    
    The queue mapping redesign that I'm planning to do
    will break pure injection unless we handle monitor
    interfaces explicitly. One possible option would
    be to have the driver tell mac80211 about monitor
    mode queues etc., but that would duplicate the API
    since we already need to have queue assignments
    handled per virtual interface.
    
    So in order to solve this, have a virtual monitor
    interface that is added whenever all active vifs
    are monitors. We could also use the state of one
    of the monitor interfaces, but managing that would
    be complicated, so allocate separate state.
