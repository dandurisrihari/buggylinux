Full commit message:
wifi: ipw2x00: refactor to use kstrtoul

The current implementation seems to reinvent what `kstrtoul` already does
in terms of functionality and error handling. Remove uses of `simple_strtoul()`
in favor of `kstrtoul()`.

There is the following note at `lib/vsprintf.c:simple_strtoull()` which
further backs this change:
| * This function has caveats. Please use kstrtoull (or kstrtoul) instead.

And here, simple_str* are explicitly deprecated [3].

This patch also removes an instance of the deprecated `strncpy` which helps [2].

Compile tested only.
