    Pull Documentation updates from Jon Corbet:
     "A bit busier this time around.
    
      The most interesting thing (IMO) this time around is some beginning
      infrastructural work to allow documents to be written using
      restructured text.  Maybe someday, in a galaxy far far away, we'll be
      able to eliminate the DocBook dependency and have a much better
      integrated set of kernel docs.  Someday.
    
      Beyond that, there's a new document on security hardening from Kees,
      the movement of some sample code over to samples/, a number of
      improvements to the serial docs from Geert, and the usual collection
      of corrections, typo fixes, etc"
