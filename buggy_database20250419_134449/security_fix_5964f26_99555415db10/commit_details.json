  "body": "This patch replaces the seqniv generator with seqiv when the\nunderlying algorithm understands the new calling convention.\n\nThis not only makes more sense as now seqiv is solely responsible\nfor IV generation rather than also determining how the IV is going\nto be used, it also allows for optimisations in the underlying\nimplementation.  For example, the space for the IV could be used\nto add padding for authentication.\n\nThis patch also removes the unnecessary copying of IV to dst\nduring seqiv decryption as the IV is part of the AD and not cipher\ntext.\n\nSigned-off-by: Herbert Xu <herbert@gondor.apana.org.au>",
