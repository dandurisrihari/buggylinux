Full commit message:
accel/ivpu: Add support for hardware fault injection

Introduces the capability to simulate hardware faults for testing
purposes. The new `fail_hw` fault can be injected in
`ivpu_hw_reg_poll_fld()`, which is used in various parts of the driver
to wait for the hardware to reach a specific state. This allows to test
failures during NPU boot and shutdown, IPC message handling and more.

Fault injection can be enabled using debugfs or a module parameter.
