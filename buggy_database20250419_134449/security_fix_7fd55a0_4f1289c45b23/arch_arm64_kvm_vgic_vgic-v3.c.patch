    Merge tag 'kvmarm-5.17' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/kvmarm/kvmarm into HEAD
    
    KVM/arm64 updates for Linux 5.16
    
    - Simplification of the 'vcpu first run' by integrating it into
      KVM's 'pid change' flow
    
    - Refactoring of the FP and SVE state tracking, also leading to
      a simpler state and less shared data between EL1 and EL2 in
      the nVHE case
    
    - Tidy up the header file usage for the nvhe hyp object
    
    - New HYP unsharing mechanism, finally allowing pages to be
      unmapped from the Stage-1 EL2 page-tables
    
    - Various pKVM cleanups around refcounting and sharing
    
    - A couple of vgic fixes for bugs that would trigger once
      the vcpu xarray rework is merged, but not sooner
    
    - Add minimal support for ARMv8.7's PMU extension
    
    - Rework kvm_pgtable initialisation ahead of the NV work
    
    - New selftest for IRQ injection
    
    - Teach selftests about the lack of default IPA space and
      page sizes
    
    - Expand sysreg selftest to deal with Pointer Authentication
    
    - The usual bunch of cleanups and doc update
