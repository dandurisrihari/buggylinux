    KVM: rename kvm_arch_can_inject_async_page_present() to kvm_arch_can_dequeue_async_page_present()
    
    An innocent reader of the following x86 KVM code:
    
    bool kvm_arch_can_inject_async_page_present(struct kvm_vcpu *vcpu)
    {
            if (!(vcpu->arch.apf.msr_val & KVM_ASYNC_PF_ENABLED))
                    return true;
    ...
    
    may get very confused: if APF mechanism is not enabled, why do we report
    that we 'can inject async page present'? In reality, upon injection
    kvm_arch_async_page_present() will check the same condition again and,
    in case APF is disabled, will just drop the item. This is fine as the
    guest which deliberately disabled APF doesn't expect to get any APF
    notifications.
    
    Rename kvm_arch_can_inject_async_page_present() to
    kvm_arch_can_dequeue_async_page_present() to make it clear what we are
    checking: if the item can be dequeued (meaning either injected or just
    dropped).
    
    On s390 kvm_arch_can_inject_async_page_present() always returns 'true' so
    the rename doesn't matter much.
