    Pull networking updates from David Miller:
    
     1) Support offloading wireless authentication to userspace via
        NL80211_CMD_EXTERNAL_AUTH, from Srinivas Dasari.
    
     2) A lot of work on network namespace setup/teardown from Kirill Tkhai.
        Setup and cleanup of namespaces now all run asynchronously and thus
        performance is significantly increased.
    
     3) Add rx/tx timestamping support to mv88e6xxx driver, from Brandon
        Streiff.
    
     4) Support zerocopy on RDS sockets, from Sowmini Varadhan.
    
     5) Use denser instruction encoding in x86 eBPF JIT, from Daniel
        Borkmann.
    
     6) Support hw offload of vlan filtering in mvpp2 dreiver, from Maxime
        Chevallier.
    
     7) Support grafting of child qdiscs in mlxsw driver, from Nogah
        Frankel.
    
     8) Add packet forwarding tests to selftests, from Ido Schimmel.
    
     9) Deal with sub-optimal GSO packets better in BBR congestion control,
        from Eric Dumazet.
    
    10) Support 5-tuple hashing in ipv6 multipath routing, from David Ahern.
    
    11) Add path MTU tests to selftests, from Stefano Brivio.
    
    12) Various bits of IPSEC offloading support for mlx5, from Aviad
        Yehezkel, Yossi Kuperman, and Saeed Mahameed.
    
    13) Support RSS spreading on ntuple filters in SFC driver, from Edward
        Cree.
    
    14) Lots of sockmap work from John Fastabend. Applications can use eBPF
        to filter sendmsg and sendpage operations.
    
    15) In-kernel receive TLS support, from Dave Watson.
    
    16) Add XDP support to ixgbevf, this is significant because it should
        allow optimized XDP usage in various cloud environments. From Tony
        Nguyen.
    
    17) Add new Intel E800 series "ice" ethernet driver, from Anirudh
        Venkataramanan et al.
    
    18) IP fragmentation match offload support in nfp driver, from Pieter
        Jansen van Vuuren.
    
    19) Support XDP redirect in i40e driver, from Björn Töpel.
    
    20) Add BPF_RAW_TRACEPOINT program type for accessing the arguments of
        tracepoints in their raw form, from Alexei Starovoitov.
    
    21) Lots of striding RQ improvements to mlx5 driver with many
        performance improvements, from Tariq Toukan.
    
    22) Use rhashtable for inet frag reassembly, from Eric Dumazet.
