Merge tag 'arm64-upstream' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/arm64/linux

Pull more arm64 updates from Will Deacon:
 "A few late updates to address some issues arising from conflicts with
  other trees:

   - Removal of Qualcomm-specific Spectre-v2 mitigation in favour of the
     generic SMCCC-based firmware call

   - Fix EL2 hardening capability checking, which was bodged to reduce
     conflicts with the KVM tree

   - Add some currently unused assembler macros for managing SIMD
     registers which will be used by some crypto code in the next merge
     window"
