Full commit message:
um: vector: refactor deprecated strncpy

`strncpy` is deprecated for use on NUL-terminated destination strings [1].

A suitable replacement is `strscpy` [2] due to the fact that it
guarantees NUL-termination on its destination buffer argument which is
_not_ the case for `strncpy`!

In this case, we are able to drop the now superfluous `... - 1`
instances because `strscpy` will automatically truncate the last byte by
setting it to a NUL byte if the source size exceeds the destination size
or if the source string is not NUL-terminated.

I've also opted to remove the seemingly useless char* casts. I'm not
sure why they're present at all since (after expanding the `ifr_name`
macro) `ifr.ifr_ifrn.ifrn_name` is a char* already.

All in all, `strscpy` is a more robust and less ambiguous interface
while also letting us remove some `... -1`'s which cleans things up a
bit.
