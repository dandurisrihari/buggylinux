I'm not\nsure why they're present at all since (after expanding the `ifr_name`\nmacro) `ifr.ifr_ifrn.ifrn_name` is a char* already.\n\nAll in all, `strscpy` is a more robust and less ambiguous interface\nwhile also letting us remove some `... -1`'s which cleans things up a\nbit.\n\n[1]: www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#strncpy-on-nul-terminated-strings\n[2]: https://manpages.debian.org/testing/linux-manual-4.8/strscpy.9.en.html\n\nLink: https://github.com/KSPP/linux/issues/90\nCc: linux-hardening@vger.kernel.org\nSigned-off-by: Justin Stitt <justinstitt@google.com>\nAcked-by: Anton Ivanov <anton.ivanov@cambridgegreys.com>\nSigned-off-by: Richard Weinberger <richard@nod.at>",
