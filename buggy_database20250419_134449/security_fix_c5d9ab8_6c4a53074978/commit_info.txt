Merge tag 'f2fs-for-6.9-rc1' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jaegeuk/f2fs

Pull f2fs update from Jaegeuk Kim:
 "In this round, there are a number of updates on mainly two areas:
  Zoned block device support and Per-file compression. For example,
  we've found several issues to support Zoned block device especially
  having large sections regarding to GC and file pinning used for
  Android devices. In compression side, we've fixed many corner race
  conditions that had broken the design assumption.

  Enhancements:
   - Support file pinning for Zoned block device having large section
   - Enhance the data recovery after sudden power cut on Zoned block
     device
   - Add more error injection cases to easily detect the kernel panics
   - add a proc entry show the entire disk layout
   - Improve various error paths paniced by BUG_ON in block allocation
     and GC
   - support SEEK_DATA and SEEK_HOLE for compression files

  Bug fixes:
   - avoid use-after-free issue in f2fs_filemap_fault
   - fix some race conditions to break the atomic write design
     assumption
   - fix to truncate meta inode pages forcely
   - resolve various per-file compression issues wrt the space
     management and compression policies
   - fix some swap-related bugs

  In addition, we removed deprecated codes such as io_bits and
  heap_allocation, and also fixed minor error handling routines with
  neat debugging messages"
