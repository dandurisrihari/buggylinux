    Pull arm64 updates from Catalin Marinas:
     "The main theme of this pull request is security covering variants 2
      and 3 for arm64. I expect to send additional patches next week
      covering an improved firmware interface (requires firmware changes)
      for variant 2 and way for KPTI to be disabled on unaffected CPUs
      (Cavium's ThunderX doesn't work properly with KPTI enabled because of
      a hardware erratum).
    
      Summary:
    
       - Security mitigations:
          - variant 2: invalidate the branch predictor with a call to
            secure firmware
          - variant 3: implement KPTI for arm64
    
       - 52-bit physical address support for arm64 (ARMv8.2)
    
       - arm64 support for RAS (firmware first only) and SDEI (software
         delegated exception interface; allows firmware to inject a RAS
         error into the OS)
    
       - perf support for the ARM DynamIQ Shared Unit PMU
    
       - CPUID and HWCAP bits updated for new floating point multiplication
         instructions in ARMv8.4
    
       - remove some virtual memory layout printks during boot
    
       - fix initial page table creation to cope with larger than 32M kernel
         images when 16K pages are enabled"
