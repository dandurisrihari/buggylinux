  "subject": "arm64: Don't trap host pointer auth use to EL2",
  "body": "To allow EL0 (and/or EL1) to use pointer authentication functionality,\nwe must ensure that pointer authentication instructions and accesses to\npointer authentication keys are not trapped to EL2.\n\nThis patch ensures that HCR_EL2 is configured appropriately when the\nkernel is booted at EL2. For non-VHE kernels we set HCR_EL2.{API,APK},\nensuring that EL1 can access keys and permit EL0 use of instructions.\nFor VHE kernels host EL0 (TGE && E2H) is unaffected by these settings,\nand it doesn't matter how we configure HCR_EL2.{API,APK}, so we don't\nbother setting them.\n\nThis does not enable support for KVM guests, since KVM manages HCR_EL2\nitself when running VMs.\n\nReviewed-by: Richard Henderson <richard.henderson@linaro.org>\nSigned-off-by: Mark Rutland <mark.rutland@arm.com>\nSigned-off-by: Kristina Martsenko <kristina.martsenko@arm.com>\nAcked-by: Christoffer Dall <christoffer.dall@arm.com>\nCc: Catalin Marinas <catalin.marinas@arm.com>\nCc: Marc Zyngier <marc.zyngier@arm.com>\nCc: Will Deacon <will.deacon@arm.com>\nCc: kvmarm@lists.cs.columbia.edu\nSigned-off-by: Will Deacon <will.deacon@arm.com>",
