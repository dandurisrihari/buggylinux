Full commit message:
arm64/sysreg: refactor deprecated strncpy

`strncpy` is deprecated for use on NUL-terminated destination strings
[1]. Which seems to be the case here due to the forceful setting of `buf`'s
tail to 0.

A suitable replacement is `strscpy` [2] due to the fact that it
guarantees NUL-termination on its destination buffer argument which is
_not_ the case for `strncpy`!

In this case, we can simplify the logic and also check for any silent
truncation by using `strscpy`'s return value.

This should have no functional change and yet uses a more robust and
less ambiguous interface whilst reducing code complexity.
