  "body": "KVM: s390: Fixes and features for 3.18 part 1\n\n1. The usual cleanups: get rid of duplicate code, use defines, factor\n   out the sync_reg handling, additional docs for sync_regs, better\n   error handling on interrupt injection\n2. We use KVM_REQ_TLB_FLUSH instead of open coding tlb flushes\n3. Additional registers for kvm_run sync regs. This is usually not\n   needed in the fast path due to eventfd/irqfd, but kvm stat claims\n   that we reduced the overhead of console output by ~50% on my system\n4. A rework of the gmap infrastructure. This is the 2nd step towards\n   host large page support (after getting rid of the storage key\n   dependency). We introduces two radix trees to store the guest-to-host\n   and host-to-guest translations. This gets us rid of most of\n   the page-table walks in the gmap code. Only one in __gmap_link is left,\n   this one is required to link the shadow page table to the process page\n   table. Finally this contains the plumbing to support gmap page tables\n   with less than 5 levels.",
