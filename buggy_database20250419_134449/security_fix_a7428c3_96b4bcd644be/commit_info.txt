KVM: s390: Fixes and features for 3.18 part 1

1. The usual cleanups: get rid of duplicate code, use defines, factor
   out the sync_reg handling, additional docs for sync_regs, better
   error handling on interrupt injection
2. We use KVM_REQ_TLB_FLUSH instead of open coding tlb flushes
3. Additional registers for kvm_run sync regs. This is usually not
   needed in the fast path due to eventfd/irqfd, but kvm stat claims
   that we reduced the overhead of console output by ~50% on my system
4. A rework of the gmap infrastructure. This is the 2nd step towards
   host large page support (after getting rid of the storage key
   dependency). We introduces two radix trees to store the guest-to-host
   and host-to-guest translations. This gets us rid of most of
   the page-table walks in the gmap code. Only one in __gmap_link is left,
   this one is required to link the shadow page table to the process page
   table. Finally this contains the plumbing to support gmap page tables
   with less than 5 levels.
