Full commit message:
KVM: SVM: Treat all "skip" emulation for SEV guests as outright failures

Treat EMULTYPE_SKIP failures on SEV guests as unhandleable emulation
instead of simply resuming the guest, and drop the hack-a-fix which
effects that behavior for the INT3/INTO injection path.  If KVM can't
skip an instruction for which KVM has already done partial emulation,
resuming the guest is undesirable as doing so may corrupt guest state.
