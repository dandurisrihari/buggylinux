Full commit message:
KVM: selftests: Macrofy vm_get_stat() to auto-generate stat name string

Turn vm_get_stat() into a macro that generates a string for the stat name,
as opposed to taking a string.  This will allow hardening stat usage in
the future to generate errors on unknown stats at compile time.

No functional change intended.
