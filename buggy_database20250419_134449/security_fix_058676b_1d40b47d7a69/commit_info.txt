Full commit message:
Merge patch series "scsi: scsi_debug: Add error injection for single device"

Wenchao Hao <haowenchao2@huawei.com> says:

The original error injection mechanism was based on scsi_host which
could not inject fault for a single SCSI device.

This patchset provides the ability to inject errors for a single SCSI
device. Now we support inject timeout errors, queuecommand errors, and
hostbyte, driverbyte, statusbyte, and sense data for specific SCSI
Command. Two new error injection is defined to make abort command or
reset LUN failed.

Besides error injection for single device, this patchset add a new
interface to make reset target failed for each scsi_target.

The first two patch add a debugfs interface to add and inquiry single
device's error injection info; the third patch defined how to remove
an injection which has been added. The following 5 patches use the
injection info and generate the related error type. The last two just
add a new interface to make reset target failed and control
scsi_device's allow_restart flag.
