Two new error injection is defined to make abort command or\nreset LUN failed.\n\nBesides error injection for single device, this patchset add a new\ninterface to make reset target failed for each scsi_target.\n\nThe first two patch add a debugfs interface to add and inquiry single\ndevice's error injection info; the third patch defined how to remove\nan injection which has been added. The following 5 patches use the\ninjection info and generate the related error type.
