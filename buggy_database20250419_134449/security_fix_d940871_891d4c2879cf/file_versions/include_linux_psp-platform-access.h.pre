    crypto: ccp - Add support for fetching a nonce for dynamic boost control
    
    Dynamic Boost Control is a feature offered on AMD client platforms that
    allows software to request and set power or frequency limits.
    
    Only software that has authenticated with the PSP can retrieve or set
    these limits.
    
    Create a character device and ioctl for fetching the nonce. This ioctl
    supports optionally passing authentication information which will influence
    how many calls the nonce is valid for.
