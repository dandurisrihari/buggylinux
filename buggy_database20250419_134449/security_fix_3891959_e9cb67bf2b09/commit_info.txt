Full commit message:
eCryptfs: Validate global auth tok keys

When searching through the global authentication tokens for a given key
signature, verify that a matching key has not been revoked and has not
expired.  This allows the `keyctl revoke` command to be properly used on
keys in use by eCryptfs.
