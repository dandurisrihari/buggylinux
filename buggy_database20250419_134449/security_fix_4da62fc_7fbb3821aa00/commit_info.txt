Full commit message:
[IPVS]: Fix for overflows

From: <pageexec@freemail.hu>

$subject was fixed in 2.4 already, 2.6 needs it as well.

The impact of the bugs is a kernel stack overflow and privilege escalation
from CAP_NET_ADMIN via the IP_VS_SO_SET_STARTDAEMON/IP_VS_SO_GET_DAEMON
ioctls.  People running with 'root=all caps' (i.e., most users) are not
really affected (there's nothing to escalate), but SELinux and similar
users should take it seriously if they grant CAP_NET_ADMIN to other users.
