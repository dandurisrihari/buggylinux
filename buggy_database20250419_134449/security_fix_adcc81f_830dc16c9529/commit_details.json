  "body": "Mapping the delay slot emulation page as both writeable & executable\npresents a security risk, in that if an exploit can write to & jump into\nthe page then it can be used as an easy way to execute arbitrary code.\n\nPrevent this by mapping the page read-only for userland, and using\naccess_process_vm() with the FOLL_FORCE flag to write to it from\nmips_dsemul().\n\nThis will likely be less efficient due to copy_to_user_page() performing\ncache maintenance on a whole page, rather than a single line as in the\nprevious use of flush_cache_sigtramp(). However this delay slot\nemulation code ought not to be running in any performance critical paths\nanyway so this isn't really a problem, and we can probably do better in\ncopy_to_user_page() anyway in future.\n\nA major advantage of this approach is that the fix is small & simple to\nbackport to stable kernels.\n\nReported-by: Andy Lutomirski <luto@kernel.org>\nSigned-off-by: Paul Burton <paul.burton@mips.com>\nFixes: 432c6bacbd0c (\"MIPS: Use per-mm page to execute branch delay slot instructions\")\nCc: stable@vger.kernel.org # v4.8+\nCc: linux-mips@vger.kernel.org\nCc: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org\nCc: Rich Felker <dalias@libc.org>\nCc: David Daney <david.daney@cavium.com>",
