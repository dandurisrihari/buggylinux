Full commit message:
nvme-rdma: stop auth work after tearing down queues in error recovery

when starting error recovery there might be a authentication work
running, and it involves I/O commands. Given the controller is tearing
down there is no chance for the I/O to complete other than timing out
which may unnecessarily take a full io timeout.

So first tear down the queues, fail/cancel all inflight I/O (including
potentially authentication) and only then stop authentication. This
ensures that failover is not stalled due to blocked authentication I/O.
