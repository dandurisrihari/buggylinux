  "body": "when starting error recovery there might be a authentication work\nrunning, and it involves I/O commands. Given the controller is tearing\ndown there is no chance for the I/O to complete other than timing out\nwhich may unnecessarily take a full io timeout.\n\nSo first tear down the queues, fail/cancel all inflight I/O (including\npotentially authentication) and only then stop authentication. This\nensures that failover is not stalled due to blocked authentication I/O.\n\nSigned-off-by: Sagi Grimberg <sagi@grimberg.me>\nReviewed-by: Chaitanya Kulkarni <kch@nvidia.com>\nSigned-off-by: Christoph Hellwig <hch@lst.de>",
