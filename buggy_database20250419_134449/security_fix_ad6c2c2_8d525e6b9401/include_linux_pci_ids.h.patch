    Merge branch 'linux_next' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mchehab/linux-edac
    
    Pull EDAC fixes and ghes-edac from Mauro Carvalho Chehab:
     "For:
    
       - Some fixes at edac drivers (i7core_edac, sb_edac, i3200_edac);
       - error injection support for i5100, when EDAC debug is enabled;
       - fix edac when it is loaded builtin (early init for the subsystem);
       - a "Firmware First" EDAC driver, allowing ghes to report errors via
         EDAC (ghes-edac).
    
      With regards to ghes-edac, this fixes a longstanding BZ at Red Hat
      that happens with Nehalem and Sandy Bridge CPUs: when both GHES and
      i7core_edac or sb_edac are running, the error reports are
      unpredictable, as both BIOS and OS race to access the registers.  With
      ghes-edac, the EDAC core will refuse to register any other concurrent
      memory error driver.
    
      This patchset moves the ghes struct definitions to a separate header
      file (include/acpi/ghes.h) and adds 3 hooks at apei/ghes.c to
      register/unregister and to report errors via ghes-edac.  Those changes
      were acked by ghes driver maintainer (Huang)."
