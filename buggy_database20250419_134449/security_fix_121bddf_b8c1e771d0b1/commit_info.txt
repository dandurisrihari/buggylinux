Merge tag 'for-linus' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/rdma/rdma

Pull rdma fixes from Doug Ledford:
 "This is probably our last -rc pull request. We don't have anything
  else outstanding at the moment anyway, and with the summer months on
  us and people taking trips, I expect the next weeks leading up to the
  merge window to be pretty calm and sedate.

  This has two simple, no brainer fixes for the EFA driver.

  Then it has ten not quite so simple fixes for the hfi1 driver. The
  problem with them is that they aren't simply one liner typo fixes.
  They're still fixes, but they're more complex issues like livelock
  under heavy load where the answer was to change work queue usage and
  spinlock usage to resolve the problem, or issues with orphaned
  requests during certain types of failures like link down which
  required some more complex work to fix too. They all look like
  legitimate fixes to me, they just aren't small like I wish they were.

  Summary:

   - 2 minor EFA fixes

   - 10 hfi1 fixes related to scaling issues"
