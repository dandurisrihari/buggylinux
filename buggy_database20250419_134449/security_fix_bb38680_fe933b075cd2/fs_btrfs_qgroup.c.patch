    btrfs: do not BUG_ON() when freeing tree block after error
    
    When freeing a tree block, at btrfs_free_tree_block(), if we fail to
    create a delayed reference we don't deal with the error and just do a
    BUG_ON(). The error most likely to happen is -ENOMEM, and we have a
    comment mentioning that only -ENOMEM can happen, but that is not true,
    because in case qgroups are enabled any error returned from
    btrfs_qgroup_trace_extent_post() (can be -EUCLEAN or anything returned
    from btrfs_search_slot() for example) can be propagated back to
    btrfs_free_tree_block().
    
    So stop doing a BUG_ON() and return the error to the callers and make
    them abort the transaction to prevent leaking space. Syzbot was
    triggering this, likely due to memory allocation failure injection.
