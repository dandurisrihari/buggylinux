Full commit message:
arm64: cpufeatures: Allow disabling of Pointer Auth from the command-line

In order to be able to disable Pointer Authentication  at runtime,
whether it is for testing purposes, or to work around HW issues,
let's add support for overriding the ID_AA64ISAR1_EL1.{GPI,GPA,API,APA}
fields.

This is further mapped on the arm64.nopauth command-line alias.
