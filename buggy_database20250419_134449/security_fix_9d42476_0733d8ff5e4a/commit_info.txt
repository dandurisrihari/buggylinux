Full commit message:
drm/xe: Allow fault injection in vm create and vm bind IOCTLs

Use fault injection infrastructure to allow specific functions to
be configured over debugfs for failing during the execution of
xe_vm_create_ioctl() and xe_vm_bind_ioctl(). This allows more
thorough testing from user space by going through code paths for
error handling and unwinding which cannot be reached by simply
injecting errors in IOCTL arguments. This can help increase code
robustness.

v2: Add xe_pt_update_ops_{prepare,run} (Matthew Brost)
