Pull networking fixes from David Miller:

 1) Revert iwlwifi reclaimed packet tracking, it causes problems for a
    bunch of folks.  From Emmanuel Grumbach.

 2) Work limiting code in brcmsmac wifi driver can clear tx status
    without processing the event.  From Arend van Spriel.

 3) rtlwifi USB driver processes wrong SKB, fix from Larry Finger.

 4) l2tp tunnel delete can race with close, fix from Tom Parkin.

 5) pktgen_add_device() failures are not checked at all, fix from Cong
    Wang.

 6) Fix unintentional removal of carrier off from tun_detach(),
    otherwise we confuse userspace, from Michael S.  Tsirkin.

 7) Don't leak socket reference counts and ubufs in vhost-net driver,
    from Jason Wang.

 8) vmxnet3 driver gets it's initial carrier state wrong, fix from Neil
    Horman.

 9) Protect against USB networking devices which spam the host with 0
    length frames, from Bjørn Mork.

10) Prevent neighbour overflows in ipv6 for locally destined routes,
    from Marcelo Ricardo.  This is the best short-term fix for this, a
    longer term fix has been implemented in net-next.

11) L2TP uses ipv4 datagram routines in it's ipv6 code, whoops.  This
    mistake is largely because the ipv6 functions don't even have some
    kind of prefix in their names to suggest they are ipv6 specific.
    From Tom Parkin.

12) Check SYN packet drops properly in tcp_rcv_fastopen_synack(), from
    Yuchung Cheng.

13) Fix races and TX skb freeing bugs in via-rhine's NAPI support, from
    Francois Romieu and your's truly.

14) Fix infinite loops and divides by zero in TCP congestion window
    handling, from Eric Dumazet, Neal Cardwell, and Ilpo Järvinen.

15) AF_PACKET tx ring handling can leak kernel memory to userspace, fix
    from Phil Sutter.

16) Fix error handling in ipv6 GRE tunnel transmit, from Tommi Rantala.

17) Protect XEN netback driver against hostile frontend putting garbage
    into the rings, don't leak pages in TX GOP checking, and add proper
    resource releasing in error path of xen_netbk_get_requests().  From
    Ian Campbell.

18) SCTP authentication keys should be cleared out and released with
    kzfree(), from Daniel Borkmann.

19) L2TP is a bit too clever trying to maintain skb->truesize, and ends
    up corrupting socket memory accounting to the point where packet
    sending is halted indefinitely.  Just remove the adjustments
    entirely, they aren't really needed.  From Eric Dumazet.

20) ATM Iphase driver uses a data type with the same name as the S390
    headers, rename to fix the build.  From Heiko Carstens.

21) Fix a typo in copying the inner network header offset from one SKB
    to another, from Pravin B Shelar.
