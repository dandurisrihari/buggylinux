Full commit message:
[PATCH] USB: USB authentication states

Another hook needed for wireless USB:  there are states associated with the
device authentication protocol.  Wireless devices must authenticate using
the host system's keystore.

Note that wired connections could also use this authentication protocol, if
for no other reason than to support the most secure "simple" key exchange
protocols for wireless devices.
