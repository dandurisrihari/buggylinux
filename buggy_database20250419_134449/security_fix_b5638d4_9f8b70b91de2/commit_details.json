  "body": "A so-called \"MC-aware\" mode has recently been enabled in mlxsw. In\nMC-aware mode, BUM traffic is handled in a special way so that when a\nswitch is flooded with BUM, UC performance isn't unduly impacted.\nWithout enablement of this mode, a stream of BUM traffic can cause\nsustained UC throughput drop in excess of 99 %.\n\nAdd a test for this behavior. Compare how much UC throughput degrades as\na stream of broadcast frames floods the switch. A minimal degradation is\ntolerated to cover for glitches in traffic injection performance.\n\nSigned-off-by: Petr Machata <petrm@mellanox.com>\nReviewed-by: Jiri Pirko <jiri@mellanox.com>\nSigned-off-by: Ido Schimmel <idosch@mellanox.com>\nSigned-off-by: David S.
