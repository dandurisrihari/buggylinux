    bpf: add a bpf_override_function helper
    
    Error injection is sloppy and very ad-hoc.  BPF could fill this niche
    perfectly with it's kprobe functionality.  We could make sure errors are
    only triggered in specific call chains that we care about with very
    specific situations.  Accomplish this with the bpf_override_funciton
    helper.  This will modify the probe'd callers return value to the
    specified value and set the PC to an override function that simply
    returns, bypassing the originally probed function.  This gives us a nice
    clean way to implement systematic error injection for all of our code
    paths.
