    Pull KVM updates from Paolo Bonzini:
     "This is the first batch of KVM changes.
    
      ARM:
       - cleanups and corner case fixes.
    
      PPC:
       - Bugfixes
    
      x86:
       - Support for mapping DAX areas with large nested page table entries.
    
       - Cleanups and bugfixes here too. A particularly important one is a
         fix for FPU load when the thread has TIF_NEED_FPU_LOAD. There is
         also a race condition which could be used in guest userspace to
         exploit the guest kernel, for which the embargo expired today.
    
       - Fast path for IPI delivery vmexits, shaving about 200 clock cycles
         from IPI latency.
    
       - Protect against "Spectre-v1/L1TF" (bring data in the cache via
         speculative out of bound accesses, use L1TF on the sibling
         hyperthread to read it), which unfortunately is an even bigger
         whack-a-mole game than SpectreV1.
    
      Sean continues his mission to rewrite KVM. In addition to a sizable
      number of x86 patches, this time he contributed a pretty large
      refactoring of vCPU creation that affects all architectures but should
      not have any visible effect.
    
      s390 will come next week together with some more x86 patches"
