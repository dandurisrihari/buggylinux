Subject: HID: multitouch: validate indexes details

CVE Identifiers:
- CVE-2013-2897

Full commit message:
HID: multitouch: validate indexes details

When working on report indexes, always validate that they are in bounds.
Without this, a HID device could report a malicious feature report that
could trick the driver into a heap overflow:

[  634.885003] usb 1-1: New USB device found, idVendor=0596, idProduct=0500
...
[  676.469629] BUG kmalloc-192 (Tainted: G        W   ): Redzone overwritten

Note that we need to change the indexes from s8 to s16 as they can
be between -1 and 255.
