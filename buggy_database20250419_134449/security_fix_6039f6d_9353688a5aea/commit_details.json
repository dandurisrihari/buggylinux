  "body": "Add new nl80211 event notifications (and a new multicast group, \"mlme\")\nfor informing user space about received and processed Authentication,\n(Re)Association Response, Deauthentication, and Disassociation frames in\nstation and IBSS modes (i.e., MLME SAP interface primitives\nMLME-AUTHENTICATE.confirm, MLME-ASSOCIATE.confirm,\nMLME-REASSOCIATE.confirm, MLME-DEAUTHENTICATE.indicate, and\nMLME-DISASSOCIATE.indication). The event data is encapsulated as the 802.11\nmanagement frame since we already have the frame in that format and it\nincludes all the needed information.\n\nThis is the initial step in providing MLME SAP interface for\nauthentication and association with nl80211. In other words, kernel code\nwill act as the MLME and a user space application can control it as the\nSME.\n\nSigned-off-by: Jouni Malinen <j@w1.fi>\nSigned-off-by: John W.
