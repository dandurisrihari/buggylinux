ASoC: Intel: avs: Add data probing requests

Data probing is a cAVS firmware functionality that allows for data
extraction and injection directly from or to DMA stream. To support it,
new functions and types are added. These facilitate communication
with the firmware.

Total of eight IPCs:
- probe module initialization and cleanup
- addition and removal of probe points
- addition and removal of injection DMAs
- dumping list of currently connected probe points or enlisted DMAs
