Full commit message:
iio: adc: stm32-adc: Replace deprecated strncpy() with strscpy()

strncpy() is deprecated for use on NUL-terminated destination strings [1].

We should prefer more robust and less ambiguous string interfaces.

We expect adc->chan_name[val] to be NUL-terminated based on ch_name's
use within functions that expect NUL-terminated strings like strncmp and
printf-likes:
| 	if (!strncmp(stm32_adc_ic[i].name, ch_name, STM32_ADC_CH_SZ)) {
| 		/* Check internal channel availability */
| 		switch (i) {
| 		case STM32_ADC_INT_CH_VDDCORE:
| 			if (!adc->cfg->regs->or_vddcore.reg)
| 				dev_warn(&indio_dev->dev,
| 					 "%s channel not available\n", ch_name);
...

There is no evidence that NUL-padding is needed either.

Considering the above, a suitable replacement is strscpy() [2] due to
the fact that it guarantees NUL-termination on the destination buffer
without unnecessarily NUL-padding. If, for any reason, NUL-padding _is_
required we should go for `strscpy_pad`.
