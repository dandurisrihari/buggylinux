Vladimir Oltean says:

====================
DSA driver for Vitesse Felix switch

This series builds upon the previous "Accomodate DSA front-end into
Ocelot" topic and does the following:

- Reworks the Ocelot (VSC7514) driver to support one more switching core
  (VSC9959), used in NPI mode. Some code which was thought to be
  SoC-specific (ocelot_board.c) wasn't, and vice versa, so it is being
  accordingly moved.
- Exports ocelot driver structures and functions to include/soc/mscc.
- Adds a DSA ocelot front-end for VSC9959, which is a PCI device and
  uses the exported ocelot functionality for hardware configuration.
- Adds a tagger driver for the Vitesse injection/extraction DSA headers.
  This is known to be compatible with at least Ocelot and Felix.
