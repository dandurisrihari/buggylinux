  "body": "Vladimir Oltean says:\n\n====================\nDSA driver for Vitesse Felix switch\n\nThis series builds upon the previous \"Accomodate DSA front-end into\nOcelot\" topic and does the following:\n\n- Reworks the Ocelot (VSC7514) driver to support one more switching core\n  (VSC9959), used in NPI mode. Some code which was thought to be\n  SoC-specific (ocelot_board.c) wasn't, and vice versa, so it is being\n  accordingly moved.\n- Exports ocelot driver structures and functions to include/soc/mscc.\n- Adds a DSA ocelot front-end for VSC9959, which is a PCI device and\n  uses the exported ocelot functionality for hardware configuration.\n- Adds a tagger driver for the Vitesse injection/extraction DSA headers.\n  This is known to be compatible with at least Ocelot and Felix.\n====================\n\nSigned-off-by: David S.
