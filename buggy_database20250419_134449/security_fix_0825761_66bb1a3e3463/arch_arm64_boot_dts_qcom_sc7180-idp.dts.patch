    arm64: dts: qcom: sc7180: Drop the unused non-MSA SID
    
    Having a non-MSA (Modem Self-Authentication) SID bypassed breaks modem
    sandboxing i.e if a transaction were to originate from it, the hardware
    memory protections units (XPUs) would fail to flag them (any transaction
    originating from modem are historically termed as an MSA transaction).
    Drop the unused non-MSA modem SID on SC7180 SoCs and cheza so that SMMU
    continues to block them.
