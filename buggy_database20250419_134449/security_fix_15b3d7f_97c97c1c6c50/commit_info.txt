Oded writes:

This tag contains habanalabs driver changes for v5.12:

- Add feature called "staged command submissions". In this feature,
  the driver allows the user to submit multiple command submissions
  that describe a single pass on the deep learning graph. The driver
  tracks the completion of the entire pass by the last stage CS.

- Update code to support the latest firmware image

- Optimizations and improvements to MMU code:
  - Support page size that is not power-of-2
  - Make the locks scheme simpler
  - mmap areas in device configuration space to userspace

- Security fixes:
  - Make ETR non-secured
  - Remove access to kernel memory through debug-fs interface
  - Remove access through PCI bar to SyncManager register block
    in Gaudi

- Many small bug fixes
