    Restrict unprivileged access to kernel syslog
    
    The kernel syslog contains debugging information that is often useful
    during exploitation of other vulnerabilities, such as kernel heap
    addresses.  Rather than futilely attempt to sanitize hundreds (or
    thousands) of printk statements and simultaneously cripple useful
    debugging functionality, it is far simpler to create an option that
    prevents unprivileged users from reading the syslog.
    
    This patch, loosely based on grsecurity's GRKERNSEC_DMESG, creates the
    dmesg_restrict sysctl.  When set to "0", the default, no restrictions are
    enforced.  When set to "1", only users with CAP_SYS_ADMIN can read the
    kernel syslog via dmesg(8) or other mechanisms.
