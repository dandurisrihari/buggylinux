Full commit message:
fbdev: fbcon: Properly revert changes when vc_resize() failed

fbcon_do_set_font() calls vc_resize() when font size is changed.
However, if if vc_resize() failed, current implementation doesn't
revert changes for font size, and this causes inconsistent state.

syzbot reported unable to handle page fault due to this issue [1].
syzbot's repro uses fault injection which cause failure for memory
allocation, so vc_resize() failed.

This patch fixes this issue by properly revert changes for font
related date when vc_resize() failed.
