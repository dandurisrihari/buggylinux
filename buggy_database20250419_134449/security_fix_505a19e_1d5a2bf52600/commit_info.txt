KVM: arm64: check for ITS device on MSI injection

When userspace provides the doorbell address for an MSI to be
injected into the guest, we find a KVM device which feels responsible.
Lets check that this device is really an emulated ITS before we make
real use of the container_of-ed pointer.

  [ Moved NULL-pointer check to caller of static function
