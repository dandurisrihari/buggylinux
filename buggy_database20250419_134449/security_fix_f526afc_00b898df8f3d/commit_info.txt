ALSA: rme9652: Hardening for potential Spectre v1

As recently Smatch suggested, one place in RME9652 driver may expand
the array directly from the user-space value with speculation:
  sound/pci/rme9652/rme9652.c:2074 snd_rme9652_channel_info() warn: potential spectre issue 'rme9652->channel_map' (local cap)

This patch puts array_index_nospec() for hardening against it.
