Full commit message:
crypto: arm64/gcm-aes-ce - fix no-NEON fallback code

The arm64 gcm-aes-ce algorithm is failing the extra crypto self-tests
following my patches to test the !may_use_simd() code paths, which
previously were untested.  The problem is that in the !may_use_simd()
case, an odd number of AES blocks can be processed within each step of
the skcipher_walk.  However, the skcipher_walk is being done with a
"stride" of 2 blocks and is advanced by an even number of blocks after
each step.  This causes the encryption to produce the wrong ciphertext
and authentication tag, and causes the decryption to incorrectly fail.

Fix it by only processing an even number of blocks per step.

Fixes: 71e52c278c54 ("crypto: arm64/aes-ce-gcm - operate on two input blocks at a time")
