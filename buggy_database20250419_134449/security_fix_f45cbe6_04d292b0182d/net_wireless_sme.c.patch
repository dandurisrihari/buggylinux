    nl80211: add authorized flag to ROAM event
    
    Drivers that initiate roaming while being connected to a network that
    uses 802.1X authentication need to inform user space if 802.1X
    authentication is further required after roaming.
    For example, when using the Fast transition protocol, roaming within
    the mobility domain does not require new 802.1X authentication, but
    roaming to another mobility domain does.
    In addition, some drivers may not support 802.1X authentication
    (so it has to be done in user space), while other drivers do.
    
    Add a flag to the roaming notification to indicate if user space is
    required to do 802.1X authentication after the roaming or not.
    This flag will only be used for networks that use 802.1X
    authentication. For networks that do not use 802.1X authentication it
    is assumed that no further action is required from user space after
    the roaming notification.
