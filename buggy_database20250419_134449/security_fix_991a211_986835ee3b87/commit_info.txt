s390/cio: replace deprecated strncpy with strscpy

strncpy() is deprecated for use on NUL-terminated destination strings
[1] and as such we should prefer more robust and less ambiguous string
interfaces.

We expect both `params` and `id` to be NUL-terminated based on their
usage with format strings:

	format_node_data(iuparams, iunodeid, &lir->incident_node);
	format_node_data(auparams, aunodeid, &lir->attached_node);

	switch (lir->iq.class) {
	case LIR_IQ_CLASS_DEGRADED:
		pr_warn("Link degraded: RS=%02x RSID=%04x IC=%02x "
			"IUPARAMS=%s IUNODEID=%s AUPARAMS=%s AUNODEID=%s\n",
			sei_area->rs, sei_area->rsid, lir->ic, iuparams,
			iunodeid, auparams, aunodeid);

NUL-padding is not required as both `params` and `id` have been memset
to 0:

	memset(params, 0, PARAMS_LEN);
	memset(id, 0, NODEID_LEN);

Considering the above, a suitable replacement is `strscpy` [2] due to
the fact that it guarantees NUL-termination on the destination buffer
without unnecessarily NUL-padding.

Note that there's no overread bugs in the current implementation as the
string literal "n/a" has a size much smaller than PARAMS_LEN or
NODEID_LEN. Nonetheless, let's favor strscpy().
