    net: Implement fault injection forcing skb reallocation
    
    Introduce a fault injection mechanism to force skb reallocation. The
    primary goal is to catch bugs related to pointer invalidation after
    potential skb reallocation.
    
    The fault injection mechanism aims to identify scenarios where callers
    retain pointers to various headers in the skb but fail to reload these
    pointers after calling a function that may reallocate the data. This
    type of bug can lead to memory corruption or crashes if the old,
    now-invalid pointers are used.
    
    By forcing reallocation through fault injection, we can stress-test code
    paths and ensure proper pointer management after potential skb
    reallocations.
    
    Add a hook for fault injection in the following functions:
    
     * pskb_trim_rcsum()
     * pskb_may_pull_reason()
     * pskb_trim()
    
    As the other fault injection mechanism, protect it under a debug Kconfig
    called CONFIG_FAIL_SKB_REALLOC.
    
    This patch was *heavily* inspired by Jakub's proposal from:
