  "body": "The Speculative Store Bypass vulnerability can be mitigated with the\nReduced Data Speculation (RDS) feature. To allow finer grained control of\nthis eventually expensive mitigation a per task mitigation control is\nrequired.\n\nAdd a new TIF_RDS flag and put it into the group of TIF flags which are\nevaluated for mismatch in switch_to(). If these bits differ in the previous\nand the next task, then the slow path function __switch_to_xtra() is\ninvoked. Implement the TIF_RDS dependent mitigation control in the slow\npath.\n\nIf the prctl for controlling Speculative Store Bypass is disabled or no\ntask uses the prctl then there is no overhead in the switch_to() fast\npath.\n\nUpdate the KVM related speculation control functions to take TID_RDS into\naccount as well.\n\nBased on a patch from Tim Chen.
