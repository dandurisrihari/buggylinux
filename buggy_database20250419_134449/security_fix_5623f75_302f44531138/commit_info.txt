Full commit message:
KVM: x86: Treat #DBs from the emulator as fault-like (code and DR7.GD=1)

Add a dedicated "exception type" for #DBs, as #DBs can be fault-like or
trap-like depending the sub-type of #DB, and effectively defer the
decision of what to do with the #DB to the caller.

For the emulator's two calls to exception_type(), treat the #DB as
fault-like, as the emulator handles only code breakpoint and general
detect #DBs, both of which are fault-like.

For event injection, which uses exception_type() to determine whether to
set EFLAGS.RF=1 on the stack, keep the current behavior of not setting
RF=1 for #DBs.  Intel and AMD explicitly state RF isn't set on code #DBs,
so exempting by failing the "== EXCPT_FAULT" check is correct.  The only
other fault-like #DB is General Detect, and despite Intel and AMD both
strongly implying (through omission) that General Detect #DBs should set
RF=1, hardware (multiple generations of both Intel and AMD), in fact does
not.  Through insider knowledge, extreme foresight, sheer dumb luck, or
some combination thereof, KVM correctly handled RF for General Detect #DBs.
