Merge branches 'acpi-ec', 'acpi-apei' and 'pnp'

Merge ACPI EC driver fixes, an ACPI APEI fix and PNP fixes for
6.10-rc3:

 - Fix error handling during EC operation region accesses in the ACPI EC
   driver (Armin Wolf).

 - Fix a memory leak in the APEI error injection driver introduced
   during its converion to a platform driver (Dan Williams).

 - Fix build failures related to the dev_is_pnp() macro by redefining it
   as a proper function and exporting it to modules as appropriate and
   unexport pnp_bus_type which need not be exported any more (Andy
   Shevchenko).

* acpi-ec:
  ACPI: EC: Avoid returning AE_OK on errors in address space handler
  ACPI: EC: Abort address space access upon error

* acpi-apei:
  ACPI: APEI: EINJ: Fix einj_dev release leak

* pnp:
  PNP: Hide pnp_bus_type from the non-PNP code
  PNP: Make dev_is_pnp() to be a function and export it for modules
