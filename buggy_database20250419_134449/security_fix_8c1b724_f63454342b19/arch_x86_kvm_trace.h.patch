    Pull kvm updates from Paolo Bonzini:
     "ARM:
       - GICv4.1 support
    
       - 32bit host removal
    
      PPC:
       - secure (encrypted) using under the Protected Execution Framework
         ultravisor
    
      s390:
       - allow disabling GISA (hardware interrupt injection) and protected
         VMs/ultravisor support.
    
      x86:
       - New dirty bitmap flag that sets all bits in the bitmap when dirty
         page logging is enabled; this is faster because it doesn't require
         bulk modification of the page tables.
    
       - Initial work on making nested SVM event injection more similar to
         VMX, and less buggy.
    
       - Various cleanups to MMU code (though the big ones and related
         optimizations were delayed to 5.8). Instead of using cr3 in
         function names which occasionally means eptp, KVM too has
         standardized on "pgd".
    
       - A large refactoring of CPUID features, which now use an array that
         parallels the core x86_features.
    
       - Some removal of pointer chasing from kvm_x86_ops, which will also
         be switched to static calls as soon as they are available.
    
       - New Tigerlake CPUID features.
    
       - More bugfixes, optimizations and cleanups.
    
      Generic:
       - selftests: cleanups, new MMU notifier stress test, steal-time test
    
       - CSV output for kvm_stat"
