Ira's\n  cleanups have been long pending, I neglected to send them earlier, and\n  see no harm in including them now. This has all appeared in -next with\n  no reported issues.\n\n  Summary:\n\n   - Fix support for NFIT \"virtual\" ranges (BIOS-defined memory disks)\n\n   - Fix recovery from failed label storage areas on NVDIMM devices\n\n   - Miscellaneous cleanups from Ira's investigation of\n     dax_direct_access paths preparing for stray-write protection\"\n\n* tag 'libnvdimm-fixes-5.14-rc6' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/nvdimm/nvdimm:\n  tools/testing/nvdimm: Fix missing 'fallthrough' warning\n  libnvdimm/region: Fix label activation vs errors\n  ACPI: NFIT: Fix support for virtual SPA ranges\n  dax: Ensure errno is returned from dax_direct_access\n  fs/dax: Clarify nr_pages to dax_direct_access()\n  fs/fuse: Remove unneeded kaddr parameter",
