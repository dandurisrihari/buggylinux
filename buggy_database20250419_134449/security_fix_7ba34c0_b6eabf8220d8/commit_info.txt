Merge tag 'libnvdimm-fixes-5.14-rc6' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/nvdimm/nvdimm

Pull libnvdimm fixes from Dan Williams:
 "A couple of fixes for long standing bugs, a warning fixup, and some
  miscellaneous dax cleanups.

  The bugs were recently found due to new platforms looking to use the
  ACPI NFIT "virtual" device definition, and new error injection
  capabilities to trigger error responses to label area requests. Ira's
  cleanups have been long pending, I neglected to send them earlier, and
  see no harm in including them now. This has all appeared in -next with
  no reported issues.

  Summary:

   - Fix support for NFIT "virtual" ranges (BIOS-defined memory disks)

   - Fix recovery from failed label storage areas on NVDIMM devices

   - Miscellaneous cleanups from Ira's investigation of
     dax_direct_access paths preparing for stray-write protection"
