Full commit message:
[PATCH] Require mmap handler for a.out executables

Files supported by fs/proc/base.c, i.e.  /proc/<pid>/*, are not capable of
meeting the validity checks in ELF load_elf_*() handling because they have
no mmap handler which is required by ELF.  In order to stop a.out
executables being used as part of an exploit attack against /proc-related
vulnerabilities, we make a.out executables depend on ->mmap() existing.
