Full commit message:
gfp: add __GFP_NOACCOUNT

Not all kmem allocations should be accounted to memcg.  The following
patch gives an example when accounting of a certain type of allocations to
memcg can effectively result in a memory leak.  This patch adds the
__GFP_NOACCOUNT flag which if passed to kmalloc and friends will force the
allocation to go through the root cgroup.  It will be used by the next
patch.

Note, since in case of kmemleak enabled each kmalloc implies yet another
allocation from the kmemleak_object cache, we add __GFP_NOACCOUNT to
gfp_kmemleak_mask.

Alternatively, we could introduce a per kmem cache flag disabling
accounting for all allocations of a particular kind, but (a) we would not
be able to bypass accounting for kmalloc then and (b) a kmem cache with
this flag set could not be merged with a kmem cache without this flag,
which would increase the number of global caches and therefore
fragmentation even if the memory cgroup controller is not used.

Despite its generic name, currently __GFP_NOACCOUNT disables accounting
only for kmem allocations while user page allocations are always charged.
To catch abusing of this flag, a warning is issued on an attempt of
passing it to mem_cgroup_try_charge.
