    Pull second batch of KVM changes from Paolo Bonzini:
     "This mostly includes the PPC changes for 4.1, which this time cover
      Book3S HV only (debugging aids, minor performance improvements and
      some cleanups).  But there are also bug fixes and small cleanups for
      ARM, x86 and s390.
    
      The task_migration_notifier revert and real fix is still pending
      review, but I'll send it as soon as possible after -rc1"
