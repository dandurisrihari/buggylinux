Full commit message:
Merge tag 'random_for_linus_stable' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tytso/random

Pull random fixes from Ted Ts'o:
 "In reaction to the fixes to address CVE-2018-1108, some Linux
  distributions that have certain systemd versions in some cases
  combined with patches to libcrypt for FIPS/FEDRAMP compliance, have
  led to boot-time stalls for some hardware.

  The reaction by some distros and Linux sysadmins has been to install
  packages that try to do complicated things with the CPU and hope that
  leads to randomness.

  To mitigate this, if RDRAND is available, mix it into entropy provided
  by userspace. It won't hurt, and it will probably help"
