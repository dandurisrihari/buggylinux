    sched: Add new scheduler syscalls to support an extended scheduling parameters ABI
    
    Add the syscalls needed for supporting scheduling algorithms
    with extended scheduling parameters (e.g., SCHED_DEADLINE).
    
    In general, it makes possible to specify a periodic/sporadic task,
    that executes for a given amount of runtime at each instance, and is
    scheduled according to the urgency of their own timing constraints,
    i.e.:
    
     - a (maximum/typical) instance execution time,
     - a minimum interval between consecutive instances,
     - a time constraint by which each instance must be completed.
    
    Thus, both the data structure that holds the scheduling parameters of
    the tasks and the system calls dealing with it must be extended.
    Unfortunately, modifying the existing struct sched_param would break
    the ABI and result in potentially serious compatibility issues with
    legacy binaries.
    
    For these reasons, this patch:
    
     - defines the new struct sched_attr, containing all the fields
       that are necessary for specifying a task in the computational
       model described above;
    
     - defines and implements the new scheduling related syscalls that
       manipulate it, i.e., sched_setattr() and sched_getattr().
    
    Syscalls are introduced for x86 (32 and 64 bits) and ARM only, as a
    proof of concept and for developing and testing purposes. Making them
    available on other architectures is straightforward.
    
    Since no "user" for these new parameters is introduced in this patch,
    the implementation of the new system calls is just identical to their
    already existing counterpart. Future patches that implement scheduling
    policies able to exploit the new data structure must also take care of
    modifying the sched_*attr() calls accordingly with their own purposes.

+ * Extended scheduling parameters data structure.
+ *
+ * This is needed because the original struct sched_param can not be
+ * altered without introducing ABI issues with legacy applications
+ * (e.g., in sched_getparam()).
+ *
+ * However, the possibility of specifying more than just a priority for
+ * the tasks may be useful for a wide variety of application fields, e.g.,
+ * multimedia, streaming, automation and control, and many others.
+ *
+ * This variant (sched_attr) is meant at describing a so-called
+ * sporadic time-constrained task. In such model a task is specified by:
+ *  - the activation period or minimum instance inter-arrival time;
+ *  - the maximum (or average, depending on the actual scheduling
+ *    discipline) computation time of all instances, a.k.a. runtime;
+ *  - the deadline (relative to the actual activation time) of each
+ *    instance.
+ * Very briefly, a periodic (sporadic) task asks for the execution of
+ * some specific computation --which is typically called an instance--
+ * (at most) every period. Moreover, each instance typically lasts no more
+ * than the runtime and must be completed by time instant t equal to
+ * the instance activation time + the deadline.
+ *
+ * This is reflected by the actual fields of the sched_attr structure:
+ *
+ *  @size		size of the structure, for fwd/bwd compat.
+ *
+ *  @sched_policy	task's scheduling policy
+ *  @sched_flags	for customizing the scheduler behaviour
+ *  @sched_nice		task's nice value      (SCHED_NORMAL/BATCH)
+ *  @sched_priority	task's static priority (SCHED_FIFO/RR)
+ *  @sched_deadline	representative of the task's deadline
+ *  @sched_runtime	representative of the task's runtime
+ *  @sched_period	representative of the task's period
+ *
+ * Given this task model, there are a multiplicity of scheduling algorithms
+ * and policies, that can be used to ensure all the tasks will make their
+ * timing constraints.
