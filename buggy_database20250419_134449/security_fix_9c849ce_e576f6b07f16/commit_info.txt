Merge tag '5.15-rc-smb3-fixes-part1' of git://git.samba.org/sfrench/cifs-2.6

Pull cifs client updates from Steve French:
 "Eleven cifs/smb3 client fixes:

   - mostly restructuring to allow disabling less secure algorithms
     (this will allow eventual removing rc4 and md4 from general use in
     the kernel)

   - four fixes, including two for stable

   - enable r/w support with fscache and cifs.ko

  I am working on a larger set of changes (the usual ... multichannel,
  auth and signing improvements), but wanted to get these in earlier to
  reduce chance of merge conflicts later in the merge window"
