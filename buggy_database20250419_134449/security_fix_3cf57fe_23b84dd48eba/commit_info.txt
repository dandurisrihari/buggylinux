KVM: PIT: fix injection logic and count

The PIT injection logic is problematic under the following cases:

1) If there is a higher priority vector to be delivered by the time
kvm_pit_timer_intr_post is invoked ps->inject_pending won't be set.
This opens the possibility for missing many PIT event injections (say if
guest executes hlt at this point).

2) ps->inject_pending is racy with more than two vcpus. Since there's no locking
around read/dec of pt->pending, two vcpu's can inject two interrupts for a single
pt->pending count.

Fix 1 by using an irq ack notifier: only reinject when the previous irq
has been acked. Fix 2 with appropriate locking around manipulation of
pending count and irq_ack by the injection / ack paths.
