Full commit message:
c2port: replace deprecated strncpy with strscpy

`strncpy` is deprecated for use on NUL-terminated destination strings
[1] and as such we should prefer more robust and less ambiguous string
interfaces.

We expect `c2dev->name` to be NUL-terminated based on its usage with
format strings:
|       dev_info(c2dev->dev, "C2 port %s removed\n", c2dev->name);

Moreover, NUL-padding is _not_ required as c2dev is zero-allocated:
|       c2dev = kzalloc(sizeof(struct c2port_device), GFP_KERNEL);

Considering the above, a suitable replacement is `strscpy` [2] due to
the fact that it guarantees NUL-termination on the destination buffer
without unnecessarily NUL-padding.

Let's also drop `C2PORT_NAME_LEN - 1` for `sizeof(dest)` which is more
idiomatic strscpy usage.
