Chuck Lever says:

====================
Another crack at a handshake upcall mechanism

Here is v10 of a series to add generic support for transport layer
security handshake on behalf of kernel socket consumers (user space
consumers use a security library directly, of course). A summary of
the purpose of these patches is archived here:

https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/1DE06BB1-6BA9-4DB4-B2AA-07DE532963D6@oracle.com/

The first patch in the series applies to the top-level .gitignore
file to address the build warnings reported a few days ago. I intend
to submit that separately. I'd like you to consider taking the rest
of this series for v6.4.

The full patch set to support SunRPC with TLSv1.3 is available in
the topic-rpc-with-tls-upcall branch here, based on net-next/main:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/cel/linux.git

This patch set includes support for in-transit confidentiality and
peer authentication for both the Linux NFS client and server.

A user space handshake agent for TLSv1.3 to go along with the kernel
patches is available in the "main" branch here:
