Full commit message:
mac80211: Don't destroy auth data in case of anti-clogging

SAE AP may reject authentication with WLAN_STATUS_ANTI_CLOG_REQUIRED.
As the user space will immediately continue the authentication flow,
there is no need to destroy the authentication data in this case.
This saves unneeded station removal and releasing the channel.
