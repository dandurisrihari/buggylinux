EDAC/versal: Add a Xilinx Versal memory controller driver

Add a EDAC driver for the RAS capabilities on the Xilinx integrated DDR
Memory Controllers (DDRMCs) which support both DDR4 and LPDDR4/4X memory
interfaces. It has four programmable Network-on-Chip (NoC) interface
ports and is designed to handle multiple streams of traffic. The driver
reports correctable and uncorrectable errors, and also creates debugfs
entries for testing through error injection.

  [ bp:
   - Add a pointer to the documentation about the register unlock code.
   - Squash in a fix for a Smatch static checker issue as reported by
     Dan Carpenter:
