    EDAC/versal: Add a Xilinx Versal memory controller driver
    
    Add a EDAC driver for the RAS capabilities on the Xilinx integrated DDR
    Memory Controllers (DDRMCs) which support both DDR4 and LPDDR4/4X memory
    interfaces. It has four programmable Network-on-Chip (NoC) interface
    ports and is designed to handle multiple streams of traffic. The driver
    reports correctable and uncorrectable errors, and also creates debugfs
    entries for testing through error injection.
    
      [ bp:
       - Add a pointer to the documentation about the register unlock code.
       - Squash in a fix for a Smatch static checker issue as reported by
         Dan Carpenter:
