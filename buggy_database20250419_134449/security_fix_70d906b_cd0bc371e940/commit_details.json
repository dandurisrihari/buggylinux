  "body": "Some ciphers actually support encrypting zero length plaintexts. For\nexample, many AEAD modes support this. The resulting ciphertext for\nthose winds up being only the authentication tag, which is a result of\nthe key, the iv, the additional data, and the fact that the plaintext\nhad zero length. The blkcipher constructors won't copy the IV to the\nright place, however, when using a zero length input, resulting in\nsome significant problems when ciphers call their initialization\nroutines, only to find that the ->iv parameter is uninitialized. One\nsuch example of this would be using chacha20poly1305 with a zero length\ninput, which then calls chacha20, which calls the key setup routine,\nwhich eventually OOPSes due to the uninitialized ->iv member.\n\nSigned-off-by: Jason A.
