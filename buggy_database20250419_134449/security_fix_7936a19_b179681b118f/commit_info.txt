Full commit message:
scsi: 3w-sas: Replace deprecated strncpy() with strscpy()

strncpy() is deprecated for use on NUL-terminated destination strings
[1] and as such we should prefer more robust and less ambiguous string
interfaces.

This pattern of strncpy(dest, src, strlen(src)) is extremely bug-prone.
This pattern basically never results in NUL-terminated destination
strings unless `dest` was zero-initialized. The current implementation
may be accidentally correct as tw_dev is zero-allocated via:

	host = scsi_host_alloc(&driver_template, sizeof(TW_Device_Extension));
        ...
	tw_dev = shost_priv(host);

... wherein scsi_host_alloc() zero-allocates host:

        shost = kzalloc(sizeof(struct Scsi_Host) + privsize, GFP_KERNEL);

Also, further suggesting this change is worthwhile is another strscpy()
usage in 3w-9xxx.c:

	strscpy(tw_dev->tw_compat_info.driver_version, TW_DRIVER_VERSION,
		sizeof(tw_dev->tw_compat_info.driver_version));

Considering the above, a suitable replacement is strscpy() [2] due to
the fact that it guarantees NUL-termination on the destination buffer
without unnecessarily NUL-padding.

Let's not be accidentally correct, let's be definitely correct.
