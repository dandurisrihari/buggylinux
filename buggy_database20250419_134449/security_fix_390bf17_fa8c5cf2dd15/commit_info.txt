arm64: consolidate signal injection on emulation errors

The code for injecting a signal into userland if a trapped instruction
fails emulation due to a _userland_ error (like an illegal address)
will be used more often with the next patch.
Factor out the core functionality into a separate function and use
that both for the existing trap handler and for the deprecated
instructions emulation.
