Full commit message:
Set UID in sess_auth_rawntlmssp_authenticate too

A user complained that they were unable to login to their cifs share
after a kernel update. From the wiretrace we can see that the server
returns different UIDs as response to NTLMSSP_NEGOTIATE and NTLMSSP_AUTH
phases.

With changes in the authentication code, we no longer set the
cifs_sess->Suid returned in response to the NTLM_AUTH phase and continue
to use the UID sent in response to the NTLMSSP_NEGOTIATE phase. This
results in the server denying access to the user when the user attempts
to do a tcon connect.

See https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1163927

A test kernel containing patch was tested successfully by the user.
