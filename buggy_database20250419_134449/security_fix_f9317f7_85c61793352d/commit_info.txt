Full commit message:
hugetlb: clean up potential spectre issue warnings

Recently introduced code allows numa nodes to be specified on the kernel
command line for hugetlb allocations or CMA reservations.  The node
values are user specified and used as indicies into arrays.  This
generated the following smatch warnings:

  mm/hugetlb.c:4170 hugepages_setup() warn: potential spectre issue 'default_hugepages_in_node' [w]
  mm/hugetlb.c:4172 hugepages_setup() warn: potential spectre issue 'parsed_hstate->max_huge_pages_node' [w]
  mm/hugetlb.c:6898 cmdline_parse_hugetlb_cma() warn: potential spectre issue 'hugetlb_cma_size_in_node' [w] (local cap)

Clean up by using array_index_nospec to sanitize array indicies.

The routine cmdline_parse_hugetlb_cma has the same overflow/truncation
issue addressed in [1].  That is also fixed with this change.

As Michal pointed out, this is unlikely to be exploitable because it is
__init code.  But the patch suppresses the warnings.
