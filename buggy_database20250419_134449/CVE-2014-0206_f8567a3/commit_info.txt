CVE Identifiers:

Full commit message:
aio: fix aio request leak when events are reaped by userspace

The aio cleanups and optimizations by kmo that were merged into the 3.10
tree added a regression for userspace event reaping.  Specifically, the
reference counts are not decremented if the event is reaped in userspace,
leading to the application being unable to submit further aio requests.
This patch applies to 3.12+.  A separate backport is required for 3.10/3.11.
This issue was uncovered as part of CVE-2014-0206.
