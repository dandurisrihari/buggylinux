  "body": "The aio cleanups and optimizations by kmo that were merged into the 3.10\ntree added a regression for userspace event reaping.  Specifically, the\nreference counts are not decremented if the event is reaped in userspace,\nleading to the application being unable to submit further aio requests.\nThis patch applies to 3.12+.  A separate backport is required for 3.10/3.11.\nThis issue was uncovered as part of CVE-2014-0206.\n\nSigned-off-by: Benjamin LaHaise <bcrl@kvack.org>\nCc: stable@vger.kernel.org\nCc: Kent Overstreet <kmo@daterainc.com>\nCc: Mateusz Guzik <mguzik@redhat.com>\nCc: Petr Matousek <pmatouse@redhat.com>",
