Full commit message:
null_blk: add option for managing IO timeouts

Use the fault injection framework to provide a way for null_blk
to configure timeouts. This only works for queue_mode 1 and 2,
since the bio mode doesn't have code for tracking timeouts.

Let's say you want to have a 10% chance of timing out every
100,000 requests, and for 5 total timeouts, you could do:

modprobe null_blk timeout="100000,10,0,5"

This is useful for adding blktests to test that IO timeouts
are handled appropriately.
