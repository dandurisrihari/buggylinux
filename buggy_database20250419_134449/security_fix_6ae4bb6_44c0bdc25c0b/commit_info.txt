carl9170: remove eeprom data injection option

In the early days, this was a quite useful software
feature for testing different regdomains and chain
configurations without adding debugfs cruft into
the driver. Nowadays, the driver's phy code seems
to be stable and there's no need for it anymore.
Therefore I decided to removed altogether.
