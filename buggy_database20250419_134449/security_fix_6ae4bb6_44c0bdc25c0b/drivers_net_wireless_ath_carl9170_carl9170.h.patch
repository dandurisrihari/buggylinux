    carl9170: remove eeprom data injection option
    
    In the early days, this was a quite useful software
    feature for testing different regdomains and chain
    configurations without adding debugfs cruft into
    the driver. Nowadays, the driver's phy code seems
    to be stable and there's no need for it anymore.
    Therefore I decided to removed altogether.
