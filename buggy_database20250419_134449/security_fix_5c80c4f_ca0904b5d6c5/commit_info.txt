Full commit message:
isdn: replace deprecated strncpy with strscpy

`strncpy` is deprecated for use on NUL-terminated destination strings
[1] and as such we should prefer more robust and less ambiguous string
interfaces.

We expect `iclock->name` to be NUL-terminated based on its use within
printk:
|	printk(KERN_DEBUG "%s: %s %d\n", __func__, iclock->name,
|	       iclock->pri);

`iclock` is zero-initialized and as such is already NUL-padded which
means strncpy is doing extra work here by eagerly NUL-padding the
destination buffer.

Considering the above, a suitable replacement is `strscpy` [2] due to
the fact that it guarantees NUL-termination on the destination buffer
without unnecessarily NUL-padding.
