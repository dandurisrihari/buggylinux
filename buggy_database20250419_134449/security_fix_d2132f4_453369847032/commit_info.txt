Full commit message:
mm: security: Allow default HARDENED_USERCOPY to be set at compile time

HARDENED_USERCOPY defaults to on if enabled at compile time. Allow
hardened_usercopy= default to be set at compile time similar to
init_on_alloc= and init_on_free=. The intent is that hardening
options that can be disabled at runtime can set their default at
build time.
