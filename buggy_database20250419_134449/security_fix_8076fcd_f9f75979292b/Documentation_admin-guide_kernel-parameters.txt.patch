    x86/rfds: Mitigate Register File Data Sampling (RFDS)
    
    RFDS is a CPU vulnerability that may allow userspace to infer kernel
    stale data previously used in floating point registers, vector registers
    and integer registers. RFDS only affects certain Intel Atom processors.
    
    Intel released a microcode update that uses VERW instruction to clear
    the affected CPU buffers. Unlike MDS, none of the affected cores support
    SMT.
    
    Add RFDS bug infrastructure and enable the VERW based mitigation by
    default, that clears the affected buffers just before exiting to
    userspace. Also add sysfs reporting and cmdline parameter
    "reg_file_data_sampling" to control the mitigation.
