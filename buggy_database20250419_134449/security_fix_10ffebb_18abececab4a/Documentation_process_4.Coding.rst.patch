    docs: fault-injection: convert docs to ReST and rename to *.rst
    
    The conversion is actually:
      - add blank lines and identation in order to identify paragraphs;
      - fix tables markups;
      - add some lists markups;
      - mark literal blocks;
      - adjust title markups.
    
    At its new index.rst, let's add a :orphan: while this is not linked to
    the main index.rst file, in order to avoid build warnings.
