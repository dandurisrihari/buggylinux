commit 10ffebbed5503b1830c7920ef528075785351be6

    docs: fault-injection: convert docs to ReST and rename to *.rst
    
    The conversion is actually:
      - add blank lines and identation in order to identify paragraphs;
      - fix tables markups;
      - add some lists markups;
      - mark literal blocks;
      - adjust title markups.
    
    At its new index.rst, let's add a :orphan: while this is not linked to
    the main index.rst file, in order to avoid build warnings.

-The lkdtm module provides an interface to crash or injure the kernel at
-predefined crashpoints to evaluate the reliability of crash dumps obtained
-using different dumping solutions. The module uses KPROBEs to instrument
-crashing points, but can also crash the kernel directly without KRPOBE
-support.
-
-
-You can provide the way either through module arguments when inserting
-the module, or through a debugfs interface.
-
-Usage: insmod lkdtm.ko [recur_count={>0}] cpoint_name=<> cpoint_type=<>
-				[cpoint_count={>0}]
-
-  recur_count : Recursion level for the stack overflow test. Default is 10.
-
-  cpoint_name : Crash point where the kernel is to be crashed. It can be
-	 one of INT_HARDWARE_ENTRY, INT_HW_IRQ_EN, INT_TASKLET_ENTRY,
-	 FS_DEVRW, MEM_SWAPOUT, TIMERADD, SCSI_DISPATCH_CMD,
-	 IDE_CORE_CP, DIRECT
-
-  cpoint_type : Indicates the action to be taken on hitting the crash point.
-     It can be one of PANIC, BUG, EXCEPTION, LOOP, OVERFLOW,
-     CORRUPT_STACK, UNALIGNED_LOAD_STORE_WRITE, OVERWRITE_ALLOCATION,
-     WRITE_AFTER_FREE,
-
-  cpoint_count : Indicates the number of times the crash point is to be hit
-    to trigger an action. The default is 10.
-
-You can also induce failures by mounting debugfs and writing the type to
-<mountpoint>/provoke-crash/<crashpoint>. E.g.,
-
-  mount -t debugfs debugfs /mnt
-  echo EXCEPTION > /mnt/provoke-crash/INT_HARDWARE_ENTRY
-
-
-A special file is `DIRECT' which will induce the crash directly without
-KPROBE instrumentation. This mode is the only one available when the module
-is built on a kernel without KPROBEs support.
