Full commit message:
nvme: enable retries for authentication commands

Authentication commands might trigger a lengthy computation on the
controller or even a callout to an external entity.
In these cases the controller might return a status without the DNR
bit set, indicating that the command should be retried.
This patch enables retries for authentication commands  by setting
NVME_SUBMIT_RETRY for __nvme_submit_sync_cmd().
