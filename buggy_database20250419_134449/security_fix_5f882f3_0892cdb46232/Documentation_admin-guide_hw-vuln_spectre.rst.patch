    x86/bugs: Clarify that syscall hardening isn't a BHI mitigation
    
    While syscall hardening helps prevent some BHI attacks, there's still
    other low-hanging fruit remaining.  Don't classify it as a mitigation
    and make it clear that the system may still be vulnerable if it doesn't
    have a HW or SW mitigation enabled.
