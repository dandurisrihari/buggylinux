Full commit message:
arm64: Rename ARM64_HARDEN_BRANCH_PREDICTOR to ARM64_SPECTRE_V2

For better or worse, the world knows about "Spectre" and not about
"Branch predictor hardening". Rename ARM64_HARDEN_BRANCH_PREDICTOR to
ARM64_SPECTRE_V2 as part of moving all of the Spectre mitigations into
their own little corner.
