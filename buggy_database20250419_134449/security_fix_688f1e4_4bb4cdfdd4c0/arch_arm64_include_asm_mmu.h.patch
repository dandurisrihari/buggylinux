    arm64: Rename ARM64_HARDEN_BRANCH_PREDICTOR to ARM64_SPECTRE_V2
    
    For better or worse, the world knows about "Spectre" and not about
    "Branch predictor hardening". Rename ARM64_HARDEN_BRANCH_PREDICTOR to
    ARM64_SPECTRE_V2 as part of moving all of the Spectre mitigations into
    their own little corner.
