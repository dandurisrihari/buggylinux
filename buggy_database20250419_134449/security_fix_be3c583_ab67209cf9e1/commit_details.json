  "subject": "kvm-s390: implement config_changed for virtio on s390",
  "body": "This patch implements config_changed for the s390 virtio transport.\n\nWe use the least significant bit of the interrupt parameter field\nto decide, if this interrupt should call the virtio virtqueue callback\nor the config_changed callback.\n\nThis method is compatible with old host and guest code. Old 64 bit guests\nwill not check the bit and trigger a harmless additional vring_interrupt\ncall. Old host code will never set this bit, this is also safe.\n\nThis patch also takes care of a potential future 31 bit virtio transport\nfor s390. On 31 bit _LC_PFAULT_INTPARM and __LC_EXT_PARAMS are identical.\nWe exploit the alignment of the token and fold the change bit into the\nlsb of the token itself.\n\nSigned-off-by: Christian Borntraeger <borntraeger@de.ibm.com>\nSigned-off-by: Rusty Russell <rusty@rustcorp.com.au>",
