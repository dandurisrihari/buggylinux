Full commit message:
[PATCH] Fix buffer overflow in Omnikey CardMan 4040 driver (CVE-2007-0005)

Based on a patch from Don Howard <dhoward@redhat.com>

When calling write() with a buffer larger than 512 bytes, the
driver's write buffer overflows, allowing to overwrite the EIP and
execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges.

In read(), there exists a similar problem, but coming from the device.
A malicous or buggy device sending more than 512 bytes can overflow
of the driver's read buffer, with the same effects as above.
