    mac80211: Support adding duration for prepare_tx() callback
    
    There are specific cases, such as SAE authentication exchange, that
    might require long duration to complete. For such cases, add support
    for indicating to the driver the required duration of the prepare_tx()
    operation, so the driver would still be able to complete the frame
    exchange.
    
    Currently, indicate the duration only for SAE authentication exchange,
    as SAE authentication can take up to 2000 msec (as defined in IEEE
    P802.11-REVmd D1.0 p. 3504).
    
    As the patch modified the prepare_tx() callback API, also modify
    the relevant code in iwlwifi.
