Full commit message:
net: lan966x: Add FDMA functionality

Ethernet frames can be extracted or injected to or from the device's
DDR memory. There is one channel for injection and one channel for
extraction. Each of these channels contain a linked list of DCBs which
contains DB. The DCB contains only 1 DB for both the injection and
extraction. Each DB contains a frame. Every time when a frame is received
or transmitted an interrupt is generated.

It is not possible to use both the FDMA and the manual
injection/extraction of the frames. Therefore the FDMA has priority over
the manual because of better performance values.
