Full commit message:
ALSA: HD-Audio: SKL+: abort probe if DSP is present and Skylake driver selected

Now that the SST/Skylake driver supports per platform selectors, we
can add logic to automatically select the right driver.

If the Skylake driver is selected for a specific platform, and the DSP
is detected at run-time based on the PCI class/subclass/prog-if
information, the legacy HDaudio driver aborts the probe. This will
result in a single driver probing and remove the need for modprobe
blacklists.

Follow-up patches will add a module parameter to bypass the logic if
this automatic detection fails, or if the Skylake driver is unable to
actually support the platform (firmware authentication, missing
topology file, hardware issue, etc).

The same mechanism will be used to conflicts generated by the same PCI
ID being registered by both legacy HDAuudio and SOF drivers for Intel
platforms. In other words SOF will not require changes to the HDaudio
legacy.
