    ALSA: HD-Audio: SKL+: abort probe if DSP is present and Skylake driver selected
    
    Now that the SST/Skylake driver supports per platform selectors, we
    can add logic to automatically select the right driver.
    
    If the Skylake driver is selected for a specific platform, and the DSP
    is detected at run-time based on the PCI class/subclass/prog-if
    information, the legacy HDaudio driver aborts the probe. This will
    result in a single driver probing and remove the need for modprobe
    blacklists.
    
    Follow-up patches will add a module parameter to bypass the logic if
    this automatic detection fails, or if the Skylake driver is unable to
    actually support the platform (firmware authentication, missing
    topology file, hardware issue, etc).
    
    The same mechanism will be used to conflicts generated by the same PCI
    ID being registered by both legacy HDAuudio and SOF drivers for Intel
    platforms. In other words SOF will not require changes to the HDaudio
    legacy.
