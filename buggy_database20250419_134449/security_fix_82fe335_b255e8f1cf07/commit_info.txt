====================
virtchnl: update and refactor

Jesse Brandeburg says:

The virtchnl.h file is used by i40e/ice physical function (PF) drivers
and irdma when talking to the iavf driver. This series cleans up the
header file by removing unused elements, adding/cleaning some comments,
fixing the data structures so they are explicitly defined, including
padding, and finally does a long overdue rename of the IWARP members in
the structures to RDMA, since the ice driver and it's associated Intel
Ethernet E800 series adapters support both RDMA and IWARP.

The whole series should result in no functional change, but hopefully
clearer code.

* '40GbE' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tnguy/next-queue:
  virtchnl: i40e/iavf: rename iwarp to rdma
  virtchnl: do structure hardening
  virtchnl: update header and increase header clarity
  virtchnl: remove unused structure declaration
