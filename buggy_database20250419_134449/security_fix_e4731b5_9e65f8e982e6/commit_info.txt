Full commit message:
drm/i915/huc: check HuC and GuC version compatibility on MTL

Due to a change in the auth flow on MTL, GuC 70.7.0 and newer will only
be able to authenticate HuC 8.5.1 and newer. The plan is to update the 2
binaries synchronously in linux-firmware so that the fw repo always has
a matching pair that works; still, it's better to check in the kernel so
we can print an error message and abort HuC loading if the binaries are
out of sync instead of failing the authentication.

v2: Add clarification comment, fix typo in commit msg, clean up variable
declaration (John)
