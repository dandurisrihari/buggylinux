    Pull more xen updates from Juergen Gross:
    
     - A single patch to fix the Xen security issue XSA-331 (malicious
       guests can DoS dom0 by triggering NULL-pointer dereferences or access
       to stale data).
    
     - A larger series to fix the Xen security issue XSA-332 (malicious
       guests can DoS dom0 by sending events at high frequency leading to
       dom0's vcpus being busy in IRQ handling for elongated times).
