    ALSA: pcm: Add xrun_injection proc entry
    
    This patch adds a new proc entry for PCM substreams to inject an
    XRUN.  When a PCM substream is running and any value is written to its
    xrun_injection proc file, the driver triggers XRUN.  This is a useful
    feature for debugging XRUN and error handling code paths.
    
    Note that this entry is enabled only when CONFIG_SND_PCM_XRUN_DEBUG is
    set.
