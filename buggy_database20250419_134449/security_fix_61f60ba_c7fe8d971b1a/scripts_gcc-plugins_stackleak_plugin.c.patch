commit 61f60bac8c05f8ecd2ae2a6360520b91a45be9a2

    gcc-plugins: Change all version strings match kernel
    
    It's not meaningful for the GCC plugins to track their versions separately
    from the rest of the kernel. Switch all versions to the kernel version.
    
    Fix mismatched indenting while we're at it.
