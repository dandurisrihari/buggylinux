Full commit message:
bnxt_en: Add RSS support for IPSEC headers

IPSec uses two distinct protocols, Authentication Header (AH) and
Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP).
Add support to configure RSS based on AH and ESP headers.
This functionality will be enabled based on the capabilities
indicated by the firmware in HWRM_VNIC_QCAPS.
