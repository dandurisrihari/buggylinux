This high bound allows the injection limit to grow\nbeyond max_rq_in_driver, which may then cause max_rq_in_driver itself\nto grow.\n\nHowever, since the limit is incremented by only one unit at a time,\nthere is no need for such a high bound, and just max_rq_in_driver+1 is\nenough.\n\nTested-by: Oleksandr Natalenko <oleksandr@natalenko.name>\nSigned-off-by: Paolo Valente <paolo.valente@linaro.org>\nSigned-off-by: Jens Axboe <axboe@kernel.dk>",
