    ext4: replace deprecated strncpy with alternatives
    
    strncpy() is deprecated for use on NUL-terminated destination strings
    [1] and as such we should prefer more robust and less ambiguous string
    interfaces.
    
    in file.c:
    s_last_mounted is marked as __nonstring meaning it does not need to be
    NUL-terminated. Let's instead use strtomem_pad() to copy bytes from the
    string source to the byte array destination -- while also ensuring to
    pad with zeroes.
    
    in ioctl.c:
    We can drop the memset and size argument in favor of using the new
    2-argument version of strscpy_pad() -- which was introduced with Commit
    e6584c3964f2f ("string: Allow 2-argument strscpy()"). This guarantees
    NUL-termination and NUL-padding on the destination buffer -- which seems
    to be a requirement judging from this comment:
    
    |       static int ext4_ioctl_getlabel(struct ext4_sb_info *sbi, char __user *user_label)
    |       {
    |               char label[EXT4_LABEL_MAX + 1];
    |
    |               /*
    |                * EXT4_LABEL_MAX must always be smaller than FSLABEL_MAX because
    |                * FSLABEL_MAX must include terminating null byte, while s_volume_name
    |                * does not have to.
    |                */
    
    in super.c:
    s_first_error_func is marked as __nonstring meaning we can take the same
    approach as in file.c; just use strtomem_pad()
