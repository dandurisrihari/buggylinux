Full commit message:
jbd2: fix outstanding credits assert in jbd2_journal_commit_transaction()

We catch an assert problem in jbd2_journal_commit_transaction() when
doing fsstress and request falut injection tests. The problem is
happened in a race condition between jbd2_journal_commit_transaction()
and ext4_end_io_end(). Firstly, ext4_writepages() writeback dirty pages
and start reserved handle, and then the journal was aborted due to some
previous metadata IO error, jbd2_journal_abort() start to commit current
running transaction, the committing procedure could be raced by
ext4_end_io_end() and lead to subtract j_reserved_credits twice from
commit_transaction->t_outstanding_credits, finally the
t_outstanding_credits is mistakenly smaller than t_nr_buffers and
trigger assert.

 write_unlock(&journal->j_state_lock);
 atomic_sub(j_reserved_credits, t_outstanding_credits); //sub once

     	             jbd2_journal_start_reserved()
     	              start_this_handle()  //detect aborted journal
     	              jbd2_journal_free_reserved()  //get running transaction
                       read_lock(&journal->j_state_lock)
     	                __jbd2_journal_unreserve_handle()
     	               atomic_sub(j_reserved_credits, t_outstanding_credits);
                       //sub again
                       read_unlock(&journal->j_state_lock);

 journal->j_running_transaction = NULL;
 J_ASSERT(t_nr_buffers <= t_outstanding_credits) //bomb!!!

Fix this issue by using journal->j_state_lock to protect the subtraction
in jbd2_journal_commit_transaction().
