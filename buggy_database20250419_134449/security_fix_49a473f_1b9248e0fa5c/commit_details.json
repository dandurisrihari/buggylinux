  "body": "Thomas Falcon says:\n\n====================\nibmvnic: Failover hardening\n\nIntroduce additional transport event hardening to handle\nevents during device reset. In the driver's current state,\nif a transport event is received during device reset, it can\ncause the device to become unresponsive as invalid operations\nare processed as the backing device context changes. After\na transport event, the device expects a request to begin the\ninitialization process. If the driver is still processing\na previously queued device reset in this state, it is likely\nto fail as firmware will reject any commands other than the\none to initialize the client driver's Command-Response Queue.\n\nInstead of failing and becoming dormant, the driver will make\none more attempt to recover and continue operation. This is\nachieved by setting a state flag, which if true will direct\nthe driver to clean up all allocated resources and perform\na hard reset in an attempt to bring the driver back to an\noperational state.\n====================\n\nSigned-off-by: David S.
