    s390/zcrypt: cleanup some debug code
    
    This patch removes most of the debug code which
    is build in when CONFIG_ZCRYPT_DEBUG is enabled.
    There is no real exploiter for this code any more and
    at least one ioctl fails with this code enabled.
    
    The CONFIG_ZCRYPT_DEBUG kernel config option still
    makes sense as some debug sysfs entries can get
    enabled with this and maybe long term a new better
    designed debug and error injection way will get
    introduced.
    
    This patch only removes code surrounded by the named
    kernel config option. This option should by default
    always be off anyway. The structs and defines removed
    by the patch have been used only by code surrounded
    by a CONFIG_ZCRYPT_DEBUG ifdef and thus can be removed
    also.
    
    In the end this patch removes all the failure-injection
    possibilities which had been available when the kernel
    had been build with CONFIG_ZCRYPT_DEBUG. It has never
    been used that much and was too unflexible anyway.
