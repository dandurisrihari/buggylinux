Full commit message:
f2fs: reduce the scope of setting fsck tag when de->name_len is zero

I recently found a case where de->name_len is 0 in f2fs_fill_dentries()
easily reproduced, and finally set the fsck flag.

Thread A			Thread B
- f2fs_readdir
 - f2fs_read_inline_dir
  - ctx->pos = d.max
				- f2fs_add_dentry
				 - f2fs_add_inline_entry
				  - do_convert_inline_dir
				 - f2fs_add_regular_entry
- f2fs_readdir
 - f2fs_fill_dentries
  - set_sbi_flag(sbi, SBI_NEED_FSCK)

Process A opens the folder, and has been reading without closing it.
During this period, Process B created a file under the folder (occupying
multiple f2fs_dir_entry, exceeding the d.max of the inline dir). After
creation, process A uses the d.max of inline dir to read it again, and
it will read that de->name_len is 0.

And Chao pointed out that w/o inline conversion, the race condition still
can happen as below:

dir_entry1: A
dir_entry2: B
dir_entry3: C
free slot: _
ctx->pos: ^

Thread A is traversing directory,
ctx-pos moves to below position after readdir() by thread A:
AAAABBBB___
        ^

Then thread B delete dir_entry2, and create dir_entry3.

Thread A calls readdir() to lookup dirents starting from middle
of new dirent slots as below:
AAAACCCCCC_
        ^
In these scenarios, the file system is not damaged, and it's hard to
avoid it. But we can bypass tagging FSCK flag if:
a) bit_pos (:= ctx->pos % d->max) is non-zero and
b) before bit_pos moves to first valid dir_entry.
