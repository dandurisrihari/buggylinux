  "body": "For authentication, we need the BSS, the link_id and the AP\nMLD address to create the link and station, (for now) the\ndriver assigns a link address and sends the frame, the MLD\naddress needs to be the address of the interface.\n\nFor association, pass the list of BSSes that were selected\nfor the MLO connection, along with extra per-STA profile\nelements, the AP MLD address and the link ID on which the\nassociation request should be sent.\n\nNote that for now we don't have a proper way to pass the link\naddress(es) and so the driver/mac80211 will select one, but\ndepending on how that selection works it means that assoc w/o\nauth data still being around (mac80211 implementation detail)\nthe association won't necessarily work - so this will need to\nbe extended in the future to sort out the link addressing.\n\nSigned-off-by: Johannes Berg <johannes.berg@intel.com>",
