That's fine, but cfg80211 assumes that it's\nstill authenticated, however, mac80211 throws away all\nstate.\n\nThis fixes mac80211 to keep track of the authentication\nin that case so that cfg80211 can request a deauth or\nnew association properly.\n\nSigned-off-by: Johannes Berg <johannes@sipsolutions.net>\nSigned-off-by: John W.
