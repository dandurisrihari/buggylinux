Full commit message:
nl80211: document NL80211_BSS_STATUS_AUTHENTICATED isn't used

The flag is no longer used (and hasn't been for a long time)
since trying to track authentication (and make decisions based
on state) was just causing issues all over - see commit
95de817b9034d50860319f6033ec85d25024694c.
