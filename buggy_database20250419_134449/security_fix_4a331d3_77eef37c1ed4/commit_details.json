  "body": "Add four test cases to verify MAB functionality:\n\n* Verify that a locked FDB entry can be generated by the bridge,\n  preventing a host from communicating via the bridge. Test that user\n  space can clear the \"locked\" flag by replacing the entry, thereby\n  authenticating the host and allowing it to communicate via the bridge.\n\n* Test that an entry cannot roam to a locked port, but that it can roam\n  to an unlocked port.\n\n* Test that MAB can only be enabled on a port that is both locked and\n  has learning enabled.\n\n* Test that locked FDB entries are flushed from a port when MAB is\n  disabled.\n\nSigned-off-by: Hans J.
