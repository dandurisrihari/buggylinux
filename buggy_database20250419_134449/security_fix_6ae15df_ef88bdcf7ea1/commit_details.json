  "body": "My router blew up earlier, but exhibited some interesting behaviour during\nits dying moments. It was broadcasting beacons but wouldn't respond to\nany authentication requests.\n\nI noticed that softmac wasn't playing nice with this, as I couldn't make it try\nto connect to other networks after it had timed out authenticating to my ill\nrouter.\n\nTo resolve this, I modified the softmac event/notify API to pass the event\ncode to the callback, so that callbacks being notified from\nIEEE80211SOFTMAC_EVENT_ANY masks can make some judgement. In this case, the\nieee80211softmac_assoc callback needs to make a decision based upon whether\nthe association passed or failed.\n\nSigned-off-by: Daniel Drake <dsd@gentoo.org>\nAcked-by: Johannes Berg <johannes@sipsolutions.net>\nSigned-off-by: John W.
