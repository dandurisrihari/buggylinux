  "body": "If a scan is queued in STA mode while the interface is in state direct\nprobe, authenticate or associate the scan is delayed until the interface\nenters disabled or associated state. But in case of direct probe-,\nauthentication- or association- timeout sta_work will not be scheduled\nanymore (without external trigger) and thus the pending scan is not\nexecuted and prevents a new scan from being triggered (-EBUSY).\n\nFix this by queueing the sta work again after direct probe-, authentication-\nand association- timeout.\n\nSigned-off-by: Helmut Schaa <helmut.schaa@googlemail.com>\nSigned-off-by: John W.
