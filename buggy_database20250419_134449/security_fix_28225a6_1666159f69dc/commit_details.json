  "subject": "mt76: mt7915: fix injected MPDU transmission to not use HW A-MSDU",
  "body": "Before, the hardware would be allowed to transmit injected 802.11 MPDUs\nas A-MSDU. This resulted in corrupted frames being transmitted. Now,\ninjected MPDUs are transmitted as-is, without A-MSDU.\n\nThe fix was verified with frame injection on MT7915 hardware, both with\nand without the injected frame being encrypted.\n\nIf the hardware cannot do A-MSDU aggregation on MPDUs, this problem\nwould also be present in the TX path where mac80211 does the 802.11\nencapsulation. However, I have not observed any such problem when\ndisabling IEEE80211_HW_SUPPORTS_TX_ENCAP_OFFLOAD to force that mode.\nTherefore this fix is isolated to injected frames only.\n\nThe same A-MSDU logic is also present in the mt7921 driver, so it is\nlikely that this fix should be applied there too. I do not have access\nto mt7921 hardware so I have not been able to test that.\n\nSigned-off-by: Johan Almbladh <johan.almbladh@anyfinetworks.com>\nSigned-off-by: Felix Fietkau <nbd@nbd.name>",
