    KVM: SVM: Require AP's "requested" SEV_FEATURES to match KVM's view
    
    When handling an "AP Create" event, return an error if the "requested" SEV
    features for the vCPU don't exactly match KVM's view of the VM-scoped
    features.  There is no known use case for heterogeneous SEV features across
    vCPUs, and while KVM can't actually enforce an exact match since the value
    in RAX isn't guaranteed to match what the guest shoved into the VMSA, KVM
    can at least avoid knowingly letting the guest run in an unsupported state.
    
    E.g. if a VM is created with DebugSwap disabled, KVM will intercept #DBs
    and DRs for all vCPUs, even if an AP is "created" with DebugSwap enabled in
    its VMSA.
    
    Note, the GHCB spec only "requires" that "AP use the same interrupt
    injection mechanism as the BSP", but given the disaster that is DebugSwap
    and SEV_FEATURES in general, it's safe to say that AMD didn't consider all
    possible complications with mismatching features between the BSP and APs.
    
    Opportunistically fold the check into the relevant request flavors; the
    "request < AP_DESTROY" check is just a bizarre way of implementing the
    AP_CREATE_ON_INIT => AP_CREATE fallthrough.
