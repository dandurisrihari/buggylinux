Merge branch 'for-next' of git://git.samba.org/sfrench/cifs-2.6

Pull CIFS fixes from Steve French:
 "Four fixes from testing at the recent SMB3 Plugfest including two
  important authentication ones (one fixes authentication problems to
  some popular servers when clock times differ more than two hours
  between systems, the other fixes Kerberos authentication for SMB3)"

* 'for-next' of git://git.samba.org/sfrench/cifs-2.6:
  fix encryption error checks on mount
  [SMB3] Fix sec=krb5 on smb3 mounts
  cifs: use server timestamp for ntlmv2 authentication
  disabling oplocks/leases via module parm enable_oplocks broken for SMB3
