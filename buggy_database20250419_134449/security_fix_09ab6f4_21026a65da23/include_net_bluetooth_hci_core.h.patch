    [Bluetooth] Enforce correct authentication requirements
    
    With the introduction of Security Mode 4 and Simple Pairing from the
    Bluetooth 2.1 specification it became mandatory that the initiator
    requires authentication and encryption before any L2CAP channel can
    be established. The only exception here is PSM 1 for the service
    discovery protocol (SDP). It is meant to be used without any encryption
    since it contains only public information. This is how Bluetooth 2.0
    and before handle connections on PSM 1.
    
    For Bluetooth 2.1 devices the pairing procedure differentiates between
    no bonding, general bonding and dedicated bonding. The L2CAP layer
    wrongly uses always general bonding when creating new connections, but it
    should not do this for SDP connections. In this case the authentication
    requirement should be no bonding and the just-works model should be used,
    but in case of non-SDP connection it is required to use general bonding.
    
    If the new connection requires man-in-the-middle (MITM) protection, it
    also first wrongly creates an unauthenticated link key and then later on
    requests an upgrade to an authenticated link key to provide full MITM
    protection. With Simple Pairing the link key generation is an expensive
    operation (compared to Bluetooth 2.0 and before) and doing this twice
    during a connection setup causes a noticeable delay when establishing
    a new connection. This should be avoided to not regress from the expected
    Bluetooth 2.0 connection times. The authentication requirements are known
    up-front and so enforce them.
    
    To fulfill these requirements the hci_connect() function has been extended
    with an authentication requirement parameter that will be stored inside
    the connection information and can be retrieved by userspace at any
    time. This allows the correct IO capabilities exchange and results in
    the expected behavior.
