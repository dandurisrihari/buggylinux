    apparmor: add user namespace creation mediation
    
    Unprivileged user namespace creation is often used as a first step
    in privilege escalation attacks. Instead of disabling it at the
    sysrq level, which blocks its legitimate use as for setting up a sandbox,
    allow control on a per domain basis.
    
    This allows an admin to quickly lock down a system while also still
    allowing legitimate use.
