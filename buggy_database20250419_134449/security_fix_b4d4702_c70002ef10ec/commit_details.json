  "body": "The emulation for smart injection commands for nfit neglected to check\nthe smart field validity flags before injecting to that field. This is\nrequired as a way to distinguish un-injection vs. leave-alone.\n\nThe emulation was also missing support for un-injection entirely. To add\nthis support, first, fix the above flags check. Second, use the\n'enable' field in the injection command to determine injection vs\nun-injection. Third, move the smart initialization struct to be a global\nstatic structure for the nfit_test module. Reference this to get the\nsmart 'defaults' when un-injecting a smart field.\n\nSigned-off-by: Vishal Verma <vishal.l.verma@intel.com>\nSigned-off-by: Dave Jiang <dave.jiang@intel.com>",
