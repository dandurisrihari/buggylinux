    thunderbolt: Allow router NVM authenticate separately
    
    It may be useful if the actual NVM authentication can be delayed to be
    run later, for instance when the user logs out. For this reason add a
    new NVM operation (AUHENTICATE_ONLY) that just triggers the authentication
    procedure over whatever was written to the NVM storage.
    
    This is not supported with Thunderbolt 1-3 devices, though.
