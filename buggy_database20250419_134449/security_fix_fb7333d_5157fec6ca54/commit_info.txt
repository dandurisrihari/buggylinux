Full commit message:
KVM: SVM: fix calls to is_intercept

is_intercept takes an INTERCEPT_* constant, not SVM_EXIT_*; because
of this, the compiler was removing the body of the conditionals,
as if is_intercept returned 0.

This unveils a latent bug: when clearing the VINTR intercept,
int_ctl must also be changed in the L1 VMCB (svm->nested.hsave),
just like the intercept itself is also changed in the L1 VMCB.
Otherwise V_IRQ remains set and, due to the VINTR intercept being clear,
we get a spurious injection of a vector 0 interrupt on the next
L2->L1 vmexit.
