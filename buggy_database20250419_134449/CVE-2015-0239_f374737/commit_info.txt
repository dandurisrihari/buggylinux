Subject: KVM: x86: SYSENTER emulation is broken

CVE Identifiers:
- CVE-2015-0239

Full commit message:
KVM: x86: SYSENTER emulation is broken

SYSENTER emulation is broken in several ways:
1. It misses the case of 16-bit code segments completely (CVE-2015-0239).
2. MSR_IA32_SYSENTER_CS is checked in 64-bit mode incorrectly (bits 0 and 1 can
   still be set without causing #GP).
3. MSR_IA32_SYSENTER_EIP and MSR_IA32_SYSENTER_ESP are not masked in
   legacy-mode.
4. There is some unneeded code.

Fix it.
