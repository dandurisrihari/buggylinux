Full commit message:
Fix sctp privilege elevation (CVE-2006-3745)

sctp_make_abort_user() now takes the msg_len along with the msg
so that we don't have to recalculate the bytes in iovec.
It also uses memcpy_fromiovec() so that we don't go beyond the
length allocated.

It is good to have this fix even if verify_iovec() is fixed to
return error on overflow.
