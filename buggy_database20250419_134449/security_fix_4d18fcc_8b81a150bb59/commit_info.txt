Full commit message:
hv_netvsc: Use vmbus_requestor to generate transaction IDs for VMBus hardening

Currently, pointers to guest memory are passed to Hyper-V as
transaction IDs in netvsc. In the face of errors or malicious
behavior in Hyper-V, netvsc should not expose or trust the transaction
IDs returned by Hyper-V to be valid guest memory addresses. Instead,
use small integers generated by vmbus_requestor as requests
(transaction) IDs.
