    nfsd: refine and rename NFSD_MAY_LOCK
    
    NFSD_MAY_LOCK means a few different things.
    - it means that GSS is not required.
    - it means that with NFSEXP_NOAUTHNLM, authentication is not required
    - it means that OWNER_OVERRIDE is allowed.
    
    None of these are specific to locking, they are specific to the NLM
    protocol.
    So:
     - rename to NFSD_MAY_NLM
     - set NFSD_MAY_OWNER_OVERRIDE and NFSD_MAY_BYPASS_GSS in nlm_fopen()
       so that NFSD_MAY_NLM doesn't need to imply these.
     - move the test on NFSEXP_NOAUTHNLM out of nfsd_permission() and
       into fh_verify where other special-case tests on the MAY flags
       happen.  nfsd_permission() can be called from other places than
       fh_verify(), but none of these will have NFSD_MAY_NLM.
