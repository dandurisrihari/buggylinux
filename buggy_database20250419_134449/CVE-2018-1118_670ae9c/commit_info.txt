Subject: vhost: fix info leak due to uninitialized memory

CVE Identifiers:
- CVE-2018-1118

Full commit message:
vhost: fix info leak due to uninitialized memory

struct vhost_msg within struct vhost_msg_node is copied to userspace.
Unfortunately it turns out on 64 bit systems vhost_msg has padding after
type which gcc doesn't initialize, leaking 4 uninitialized bytes to
userspace.

This padding also unfortunately means 32 bit users of this interface are
broken on a 64 bit kernel which will need to be fixed separately.

Fixes: CVE-2018-1118
