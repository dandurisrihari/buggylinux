  "body": "When trying to associate, the AP could send a deauth frame instead.\nCurrently mac80211 drops that frame and doesn't report it to the\nsupplicant, which, in some versions and/or in certain circumstances\nwill simply keep trying to associate over and over again instead of\ntrying authentication again.\n\nFix this by reacting to deauth frames while associating, reporting\nthem to the supplicant and dropping the association attempt (which\nis bound to fail.)\n\nSigned-off-by: Johannes Berg <johannes.berg@intel.com>",
