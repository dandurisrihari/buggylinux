    Merge tag 'trace-v5.12' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/rostedt/linux-trace
    
    Pull tracing updates from Steven Rostedt:
    
     - Update to the way irqs and preemption is tracked via the trace event
       PC field
    
     - Fix handling of unregistering event failing due to allocate memory.
       This is only triggered by failure injection, as it is pretty much
       guaranteed to have less than a page allocation succeed.
    
     - Do not show the useless "filter" or "enable" files for the "ftrace"
       trace system, as they have no effect on doing anything.
    
     - Add a warning if kprobes are registered more than once.
    
     - Synthetic events now have their fields parsed by semicolons. Old
       formats without semicolons will still work, but new features will
       require them.
    
     - New option to allow trace events to show %p without hashing in trace
       file. The trace file can only be read by root, and reading the raw
       event buffer did not have any pointers hashed, so this does not
       expose anything new.
    
     - New directory in tools called tools/tracing, where a new tool that
       reads sequential latency reports from the ftrace latency tracers.
    
     - Other minor fixes and cleanups.
