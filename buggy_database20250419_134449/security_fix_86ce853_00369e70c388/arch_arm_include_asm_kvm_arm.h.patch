    KVM: ARM: Inject IRQs and FIQs from userspace
    
    All interrupt injection is now based on the VM ioctl KVM_IRQ_LINE.  This
    works semantically well for the GIC as we in fact raise/lower a line on
    a machine component (the gic).  The IOCTL uses the follwing struct.
    
    struct kvm_irq_level {
            union {
                    __u32 irq;     /* GSI */
                    __s32 status;  /* not used for KVM_IRQ_LEVEL */
            };
            __u32 level;           /* 0 or 1 */
    };
    
    ARM can signal an interrupt either at the CPU level, or at the in-kernel irqchip
    (GIC), and for in-kernel irqchip can tell the GIC to use PPIs designated for
    specific cpus.  The irq field is interpreted like this:
    
     Â bits:  | 31 ... 24 | 23  ... 16 | 15    ...    0 |
      field: | irq_type  | vcpu_index |   irq_number   |
    
    The irq_type field has the following values:
    - irq_type[0]: out-of-kernel GIC: irq_number 0 is IRQ, irq_number 1 is FIQ
    - irq_type[1]: in-kernel GIC: SPI, irq_number between 32 and 1019 (incl.)
                   (the vcpu_index field is ignored)
    - irq_type[2]: in-kernel GIC: PPI, irq_number between 16 and 31 (incl.)
    
    The irq_number thus corresponds to the irq ID in as in the GICv2 specs.
    
    This is documented in Documentation/kvm/api.txt.
