drm/i915/guc: Turn on GuC/HuC auto mode

Using "enable_guc" modparam auto mode (-1) will let driver
decide on which platforms and in which configuration we want
to use GuC/HuC firmwares.

Today driver will enable HuC firmware authentication by GuC
only on Gen11+ platforms as HuC firmware is required to unlock
advanced video codecs in media driver.

Legacy platforms with GuC/HuC are not affected by this change
as for them driver still defaults to disabled(0) in auto mode.
