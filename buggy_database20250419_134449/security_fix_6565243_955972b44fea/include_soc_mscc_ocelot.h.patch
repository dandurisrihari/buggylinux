    net: mscc: ocelot: add locking for the port TX timestamp ID
    
    The ocelot_port->ts_id is used to:
    (a) populate skb->cb[0] for matching the TX timestamp in the PTP IRQ
        with an skb.
    (b) populate the REW_OP from the injection header of the ongoing skb.
    Only then is ocelot_port->ts_id incremented.
    
    This is a problem because, at least theoretically, another timestampable
    skb might use the same ocelot_port->ts_id before that is incremented.
    Normally all transmit calls are serialized by the netdev transmit
    spinlock, but in this case, ocelot_port_add_txtstamp_skb() is also
    called by DSA, which has started declaring the NETIF_F_LLTX feature
    since commit 2b86cb829976 ("net: dsa: declare lockless TX feature for
    slave ports").  So the logic of using and incrementing the timestamp id
    should be atomic per port.
    
    The solution is to use the global ocelot_port->ts_id only while
    protected by the associated ocelot_port->ts_id_lock. That's where we
    populate skb->cb[0]. Note that for ocelot, ocelot_port_add_txtstamp_skb
    is called for the actual skb, but for felix, it is called for the skb's
    clone. That is something which will also be changed in the future.
