Full commit message:
ipsec: Fix aborted xfrm policy dump crash

An independent security researcher, Mohamed Ghannam, has reported
this vulnerability to Beyond Security's SecuriTeam Secure Disclosure
program.

The xfrm_dump_policy_done function expects xfrm_dump_policy to
have been called at least once or it will crash.  This can be
triggered if a dump fails because the target socket's receive
buffer is full.

This patch fixes it by using the cb->start mechanism to ensure that
the initialisation is always done regardless of the buffer situation.
