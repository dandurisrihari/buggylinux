    Merge tag 'libnvdimm-for-4.13' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/nvdimm/nvdimm
    
    Pull libnvdimm updates from Dan Williams:
     "libnvdimm updates for the latest ACPI and UEFI specifications. This
      pull request also includes new 'struct dax_operations' enabling to
      undo the abuse of copy_user_nocache() for copy operations to pmem.
    
      The dax work originally missed 4.12 to address concerns raised by Al.
    
      Summary:
    
       - Introduce the _flushcache() family of memory copy helpers and use
         them for persistent memory write operations on x86. The
         _flushcache() semantic indicates that the cache is either bypassed
         for the copy operation (movnt) or any lines dirtied by the copy
         operation are written back (clwb, clflushopt, or clflush).
    
       - Extend dax_operations with ->copy_from_iter() and ->flush()
         operations. These operations and other infrastructure updates allow
         all persistent memory specific dax functionality to be pushed into
         libnvdimm and the pmem driver directly. It also allows dax-specific
         sysfs attributes to be linked to a host device, for example:
         /sys/block/pmem0/dax/write_cache
    
       - Add support for the new NVDIMM platform/firmware mechanisms
         introduced in ACPI 6.2 and UEFI 2.7. This support includes the v1.2
         namespace label format, extensions to the address-range-scrub
         command set, new error injection commands, and a new BTT
         (block-translation-table) layout. These updates support inter-OS
         and pre-OS compatibility.
    
       - Fix a longstanding memory corruption bug in nfit_test.
    
       - Make the pmem and nvdimm-region 'badblocks' sysfs files poll(2)
         capable.
    
       - Miscellaneous fixes and small updates across libnvdimm and the nfit
         driver.
