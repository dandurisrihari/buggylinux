Pull perf updates from Ingo Molnar:
 "The main kernel side changes in this cycle were:

   - Various Intel-PT updates and optimizations (Alexander Shishkin)

   - Prohibit kprobes on Xen/KVM emulate prefixes (Masami Hiramatsu)

   - Add support for LSM and SELinux checks to control access to the
     perf syscall (Joel Fernandes)

   - Misc other changes, optimizations, fixes and cleanups - see the
     shortlog for details.

  There were numerous tooling changes as well - 254 non-merge commits.
  Here are the main changes - too many to list in detail:

   - Enhancements to core tooling infrastructure, perf.data, libperf,
     libtraceevent, event parsing, vendor events, Intel PT, callchains,
     BPF support and instruction decoding.

   - There were updates to the following tools:

        perf annotate
        perf diff
        perf inject
        perf kvm
        perf list
        perf maps
        perf parse
        perf probe
        perf record
        perf report
        perf script
        perf stat
