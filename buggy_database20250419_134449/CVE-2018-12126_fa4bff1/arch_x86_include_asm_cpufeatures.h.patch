    Pull x86 MDS mitigations from Thomas Gleixner:
     "Microarchitectural Data Sampling (MDS) is a hardware vulnerability
      which allows unprivileged speculative access to data which is
      available in various CPU internal buffers. This new set of misfeatures
      has the following CVEs assigned:
    
         CVE-2018-12126  MSBDS  Microarchitectural Store Buffer Data Sampling
         CVE-2018-12130  MFBDS  Microarchitectural Fill Buffer Data Sampling
         CVE-2018-12127  MLPDS  Microarchitectural Load Port Data Sampling
         CVE-2019-11091  MDSUM  Microarchitectural Data Sampling Uncacheable Memory
    
      MDS attacks target microarchitectural buffers which speculatively
      forward data under certain conditions. Disclosure gadgets can expose
      this data via cache side channels.
    
      Contrary to other speculation based vulnerabilities the MDS
      vulnerability does not allow the attacker to control the memory target
      address. As a consequence the attacks are purely sampling based, but
      as demonstrated with the TLBleed attack samples can be postprocessed
      successfully.
    
      The mitigation is to flush the microarchitectural buffers on return to
      user space and before entering a VM. It's bolted on the VERW
      instruction and requires a microcode update. As some of the attacks
      exploit data structures shared between hyperthreads, full protection
      requires to disable hyperthreading. The kernel does not do that by
      default to avoid breaking unattended updates.
    
      The mitigation set comes with documentation for administrators and a
      deeper technical view"
