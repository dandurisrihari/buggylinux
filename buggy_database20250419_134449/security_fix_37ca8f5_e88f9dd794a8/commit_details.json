Especially autoumounts often mount below the root of\nthe exported tree.\nSome server implementations (justly) require full authentication for the\nso-called deep mounts. The old code used AUTH_SYS only. This caused deep\nmounts to fail on systems requiring stronger authentication..\nThe client should try both authentication types and use the first one that\nsucceeds.\nThis method was already partially implemented. This patch completes\nthe implementation for NFS2 and NFS3.\nThis patch was developed to allow Debian systems to automount home directories\non Solaris servers with krb5 authentication.\n\nTested on kernel 2.6.24-etchnhalf.1\n\nSigned-off-by: E.G.
