Full commit message:
tcp: annotate data-race around challenge_timestamp

challenge_timestamp can be read an written by concurrent threads.

This was expected, but we need to annotate the race to avoid potential issues.

Following patch moves challenge_timestamp and challenge_count
to per-netns storage to provide better isolation.

Fixes: 354e4aa391ed ("tcp: RFC 5961 5.2 Blind Data Injection Attack Mitigation")
