    Pull clk updates from Stephen Boyd:
     "Only a couple new SoCs have support added this time, primarily for
      Qualcomm SM8650 based on the diffstat. Otherwise this is a collection
      of non-critical fixes and cleanups to various clk drivers and their DT
      bindings.
    
      Nothing is changed in the core clk framework this time, although
      there's a patch to fix a basic clk type initialization function. In
      general, this pile looks to be on the smaller side.
    
      New Drivers:
       - Global, display, gpu, tcsr, and rpmh clocks on Qualcomm SM8650
       - Mediatek MT7988 SoC clocks
    
      Updates:
       - Update Zynqmp driver for Versal NET platforms
       - Add clk driver for Versal clocking wizard IP
       - Support for stm32mp25 clks
       - Add glitch free PLL setting support to si5351 clk driver
       - Add DSI clocks on Amlogic g12/sm1
       - Add CSI and ISP clocks on Amlogic g12/sm1
       - Document bindings for i.MX93 ANATOP clock driver
       - Free clk_node in i.MX SCU driver for resource with different owner
       - Update the LVDS clocks to be compatible with i.MX SCU firmware 1.15
       - Fix the name of the fvco in i.MX pll14xx by renaming it to fout
       - Add EtherNet TSN and PCIe clocks on the Renesas R-Car V4H SoC
       - Add interrupt controller and Ethernet clocks and resets on Renesas
         RZ/G3S
       - Check reset monitor registers on Renesas RZ/G2L-alike SoCs
       - Reuse reset functionality in the Renesas RZ/G2L clock driver
       - Global and RPMh clock support for the Qualcomm X1E80100 SoC
       - Support for the Stromer APCS PLL found in Qualcomm IPQ5018
       - Add a new type of branch clock, with support for controlling
         separate memory control bits, to the Qualcomm clk driver
       - Use above new branch type in Qualcomm ECPRI clk driver for QDU1000
         and QRU1000
       - Add a number of missing clocks related to CSI2 on Qualcomm MSM8939
       - Add support for the camera clock controller on Qualcomm SC8280XP
       - Correct PLL configuration in GPU and video clock controllers for
         Qualcomm SM8150
       - Add runtime PM support and a few missing resets to Qualcomm SM8150
         video clock controller
       - Fix configuration of various GCC GDSCs on Qualcomm SM8550
       - Mark shared RCGs appropriately in the Qualcomm SM8550 GCC driver
       - Fix up GPU and display clock controllers PLL configuration settings
         on Qualcomm SM8550
       - Cleanup variable init in Allwinner nkm module
       - Convert various DT bindings to YAML
       - A few kernel-doc fixes for Samsung SoC clock controllers"
