    crypto: inside-secure - Add HMAC-SHA3 family of authentication algorithms
    
    This patch adds support for hmac(sha3-224), hmac(sha3-256), hmac(sha3-384)
    and hmac(sha3-512) authentication algorithms.
    
    The patch has been tested with the eip197c_iewxkbc configuration on the
    Xilinx VCU118 development board, including the testmgr extra tests.
