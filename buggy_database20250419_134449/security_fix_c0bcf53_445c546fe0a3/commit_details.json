  "body": "This patch is to reuse ocelot functions as possible to enable PTP\nclock and to support hardware timestamping on Felix.\nOn TX path, timestamping works on packet which requires timestamp.\nThe injection header will be configured accordingly, and skb clone\nrequires timestamp will be added into a list. The TX timestamp\nis final handled in threaded interrupt handler when PTP timestamp\nFIFO is ready.\nOn RX path, timestamping is always working. The RX timestamp could\nbe got from extraction header.\n\nSigned-off-by: Yangbo Lu <yangbo.lu@nxp.com>\nSigned-off-by: David S. Miller <davem@davemloft.net>",
