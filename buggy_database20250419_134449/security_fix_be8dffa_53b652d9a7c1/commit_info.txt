Full commit message:
um: refactor deprecated strncpy to memcpy

Use `memcpy` since `console_buf` is not expected to be NUL-terminated
and it more accurately describes what is happening with the buffers
`console_buf` and `string` as per Kees' analysis [1].

Also mark char buffer as `__nonstring` as per Kees' suggestion [2].

This change now makes it more clear what this code does and that
`console_buf` is not expected to be NUL-terminated.
