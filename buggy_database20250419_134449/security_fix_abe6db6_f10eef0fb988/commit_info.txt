Full commit message:
HID: prodikeys: Replace deprecated strncpy() with strscpy()

`strncpy` is deprecated for use on NUL-terminated destination strings [1].

We should prefer more robust and less ambiguous string interfaces.

A suitable replacement is `strscpy` [2] due to the fact that it guarantees
NUL-termination on the destination buffer without unnecessarily NUL-padding.
