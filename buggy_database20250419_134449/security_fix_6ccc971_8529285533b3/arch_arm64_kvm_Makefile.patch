    KVM: arm64: nv: Add emulation for ERETAx instructions
    
    FEAT_NV has the interesting property of relying on ERET being
    trapped. An added complexity is that it also traps ERETAA and
    ERETAB, meaning that the Pointer Authentication aspect of these
    instruction must be emulated.
    
    Add an emulation of Pointer Authentication, limited to ERETAx
    (always using SP_EL2 as the modifier and ELR_EL2 as the pointer),
    using the Generic Authentication instructions.
    
    The emulation, however small, is placed in its own compilation
    unit so that it can be avoided if the configuration doesn't
    include it (or the toolchan in not up to the task).
