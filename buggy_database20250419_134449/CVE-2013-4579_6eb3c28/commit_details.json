An important fix from Marcel in the\npermission check for HCI User Channels, there was a extra check for\nCAP_NET_RAW, and it was now removed. These channels should only require\nCAP_NET_ADMIN. The other patch is a device id addition.\"\n\nOn top of that...\n\nSujith Manoharan provides a workaround for a hardware problem that\ncan result in lost interrupts.\n\nLarry Finger fixes an oops when unloading the rtlwifi driver (Red\nHat bug 852761).\n\nMathy Vanhoef fixes a somewhat minor MAC address privacy issue\n(CVE-2013-4579).\n====================\n\nSigned-off-by: David S.
