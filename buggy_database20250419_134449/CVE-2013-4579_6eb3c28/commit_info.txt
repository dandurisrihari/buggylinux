Merge branch 'for-davem' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/linville/wireless

John W. Linville says:

====================
Please consider pulling this batch of fixes for the 3.13 stream...

For the mac80211 bits, Johannes says:

"Here's a fix for another potential radiotap parser buffer overrun thanks
to Evan Huus, and a fix for a cfg80211 warning in a certain corner case
(reconnecting to the same BSS)."

For the bluetooth bits, Gustavo says:

"Two patches in this pull request. An important fix from Marcel in the
permission check for HCI User Channels, there was a extra check for
CAP_NET_RAW, and it was now removed. These channels should only require
CAP_NET_ADMIN. The other patch is a device id addition."

On top of that...

Sujith Manoharan provides a workaround for a hardware problem that
can result in lost interrupts.

Larry Finger fixes an oops when unloading the rtlwifi driver (Red
Hat bug 852761).

Mathy Vanhoef fixes a somewhat minor MAC address privacy issue
(CVE-2013-4579).
