  "body": "The en/disable_irq() functions keep track of the 'depth': i.e. if\ninterrupts are disabled twice, then it needs to enable_irq() calls to\nenable them again. The cec-pin framework didn't take this into accound\nand could disable irqs multiple times, and it expected that a single\nenable_irq() would enable them again.\n\nMove all calls to en/disable_irq() to the kthread where it is easy\nto keep track of the current irq state and ensure that multiple\nen/disable_irq calls never happen.\n\nIf interrupts where disabled twice, then they would never turn on\nagain, leaving the CEC adapter in a dead state.\n\nSigned-off-by: Hans Verkuil <hverkuil-cisco@xs4all.nl>\nFixes: 865463fc03ed (media: cec-pin: add error injection support)\nCc: <stable@vger.kernel.org>\nSigned-off-by: Mauro Carvalho Chehab <mchehab+huawei@kernel.org>",
