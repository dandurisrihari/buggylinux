Full commit message:
[SCSI] qla2xxx: Refactor request/response-queue register handling.

Original code used an overabundance of indirect pointers to
function helpers.  Instead, the driver can exploit the immutable
properties of a queue's ISP-association and ID, which are both
known at queue initialization-time.
