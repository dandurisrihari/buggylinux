Full commit message:
virt: acrn: replace deprecated strncpy with strscpy

strncpy() is deprecated for use on NUL-terminated destination strings
[1] and as such we should prefer more robust and less ambiguous string
interfaces.

We can see that client->name should be NUL-terminated based on its usage
with a %s C-string format specifier.
|	client->thread = kthread_run(ioreq_task, client, "VM%u-%s",
|					client->vm->vmid, client->name);

NUL-padding is not required as client is already zero-allocated:
|	client = kzalloc(sizeof(*client), GFP_KERNEL);

Considering the above, a suitable replacement is `strscpy` [2] due to
the fact that it guarantees NUL-termination on the destination buffer
without unnecessarily NUL-padding.

Note that this patch relies on the _new_ 2-argument version of strscpy()
introduced in Commit e6584c3964f2f ("string: Allow 2-argument
strscpy()").
