  "body": "On http://vladz.devzero.fr/013_ptmx-timing.php, we can see how to find\nout length of a password using timestamps of /dev/ptmx. It is\ndocumented in \"Timing Analysis of Keystrokes and Timing Attacks on\nSSH\". To avoid that problem, do not update time when reading\nfrom/writing to a TTY.\n\nI am afraid of regressions as this is a behavior we have since 0.97\nand apps may expect the time to be current, e.g. for monitoring\nwhether there was a change on the TTY. Now, there is no change. So\nthis would better have a lot of testing before it goes upstream.\n\nReferences: CVE-2013-0160\n\nSigned-off-by: Jiri Slaby <jslaby@suse.cz>\nCc: stable <stable@vger.kernel.org> # after 3.9 is out\nSigned-off-by: Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org>",
