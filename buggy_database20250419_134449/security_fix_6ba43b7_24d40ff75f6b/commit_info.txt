Full commit message:
bpf: Attachment verification for BPF_MODIFY_RETURN

- Allow BPF_MODIFY_RETURN attachment only to functions that are:

    * Whitelisted for error injection by checking
      within_error_injection_list. Similar discussions happened for the
      bpf_override_return helper.

    * security hooks, this is expected to be cleaned up with the LSM
      changes after the KRSI patches introduce the LSM_HOOK macro:

        https://lore.kernel.org/bpf/20200220175250.10795-1-kpsingh@chromium.org/

- The attachment is currently limited to functions that return an int.
  This can be extended later other types (e.g. PTR).
