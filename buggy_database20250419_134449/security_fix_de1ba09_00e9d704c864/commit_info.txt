Full commit message:
[PATCH] fault injection: documentation and scripts

This patch set provides some fault-injection capabilities.

- kmalloc() failures

- alloc_pages() failures

- disk IO errors

We can see what really happens if those failures happen.

In order to enable these fault-injection capabilities:

1. Enable relevant config options (CONFIG_FAILSLAB, CONFIG_PAGE_ALLOC,
   CONFIG_MAKE_REQUEST) and if you want to configure them via debugfs,
   enable CONFIG_FAULT_INJECTION_DEBUG_FS.

2. Build and boot with this kernel

3. Configure fault-injection capabilities behavior by boot option or debugfs

   - Boot option

     failslab=
     fail_page_alloc=
     fail_make_request=

   - Debugfs

     /debug/failslab/*
     /debug/fail_page_alloc/*
     /debug/fail_make_request/*

   Please refer to the Documentation/fault-injection/fault-injection.txt
   for details.

4. See what really happens.
