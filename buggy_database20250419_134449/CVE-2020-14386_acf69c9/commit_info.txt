Subject: net/packet: fix overflow in tpacket_rcv

CVE Identifiers:
- CVE-2020-14386

Full commit message:
net/packet: fix overflow in tpacket_rcv

Using tp_reserve to calculate netoff can overflow as
tp_reserve is unsigned int and netoff is unsigned short.

This may lead to macoff receving a smaller value then
sizeof(struct virtio_net_hdr), and if po->has_vnet_hdr
is set, an out-of-bounds write will occur when
calling virtio_net_hdr_from_skb.

The bug is fixed by converting netoff to unsigned int
and checking if it exceeds USHRT_MAX.

This addresses CVE-2020-14386
