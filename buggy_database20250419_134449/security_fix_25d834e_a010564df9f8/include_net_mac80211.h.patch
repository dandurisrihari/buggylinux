    mac80211: fix virtual interfaces vs. injection
    
    Currently, virtual interface pointers passed to drivers might be
    from monitor interfaces and as such completely uninitialised
    because we do not tell the driver about monitor interfaces when
    those are created. Instead of passing them, we should therefore
    indicate to the driver that there is no information; do that by
    passing a NULL value and adjust drivers to cope with it.
    
    As a result, some mac80211 API functions also need to cope with
    a NULL vif pointer so drivers can still call them unconditionally.
    
    Also, when injecting frames we really don't want to pass NULL all
    the time, if we know we are the source address of a frame and have
    a local interface for that address, we can to use that interface.
    This also helps with processing the frame correctly for that
    interface which will help the 802.11w implementation. It's not
    entirely correct for VLANs or WDS interfaces because there the MAC
    address isn't unique, but it's already a lot better than what we
    do now.
    
    Finally, when injecting without a matching local interface, don't
    assign sequence numbers at all.
