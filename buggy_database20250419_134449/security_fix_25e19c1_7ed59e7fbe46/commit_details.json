  "body": "Pull libnvdimm fixes from Dan Williams:\n \"A small batch of fixes for v4.20-rc3.\n\n  The overflow continuation fix addresses something that has been broken\n  for several releases. Arguably it could wait even longer, but it's a\n  one line fix and this finishes the last of the known address range\n  scrub bug reports. The revert addresses a lockdep regression. The unit\n  tests are not critical to fix, but no reason to hold this fix back.\n\n  Summary:\n\n   - Address Range Scrub overflow continuation handling has been broken\n     since it was initially merged. It was only recently that error\n     injection and platform-BIOS support enabled this corner case to be\n     exercised.\n\n   - The recent attempt to provide more isolation for the kernel Address\n     Range Scrub state machine from userapace initiated sessions\n     triggers a lockdep report. Revert and try again at the next merge\n     window.\n\n   - Fix a kasan reported buffer overflow in libnvdimm unit test\n     infrastrucutre (nfit_test)\"\n\n* tag 'libnvdimm-fixes-4.20-rc3' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/nvdimm/nvdimm:\n  Revert \"acpi, nfit: Further restrict userspace ARS start requests\"\n  acpi, nfit: Fix ARS overflow continuation\n  tools/testing/nvdimm: Fix the array size for dimm devices.",
