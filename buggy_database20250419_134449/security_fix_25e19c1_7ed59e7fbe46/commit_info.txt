Merge tag 'libnvdimm-fixes-4.20-rc3' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/nvdimm/nvdimm

Pull libnvdimm fixes from Dan Williams:
 "A small batch of fixes for v4.20-rc3.

  The overflow continuation fix addresses something that has been broken
  for several releases. Arguably it could wait even longer, but it's a
  one line fix and this finishes the last of the known address range
  scrub bug reports. The revert addresses a lockdep regression. The unit
  tests are not critical to fix, but no reason to hold this fix back.

  Summary:

   - Address Range Scrub overflow continuation handling has been broken
     since it was initially merged. It was only recently that error
     injection and platform-BIOS support enabled this corner case to be
     exercised.

   - The recent attempt to provide more isolation for the kernel Address
     Range Scrub state machine from userapace initiated sessions
     triggers a lockdep report. Revert and try again at the next merge
     window.

   - Fix a kasan reported buffer overflow in libnvdimm unit test
     infrastrucutre (nfit_test)"
