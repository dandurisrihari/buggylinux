Full commit message:
Merge branch 'slab/for-6.6/random_kmalloc' into slab/for-next

Merge the new hardening feature to make heap spraying harder, by GONG,
Ruiqi. It creates multiple (16) copies of kmalloc caches, reducing the
chance of an attacker-controllable allocation site to land in the same
slab as e.g.  an allocation site with use-after-free vulnerability. The
selection of the copy is derived from the allocation site address,
including a per-boot random seed.

In line with SLAB deprecation, this is a SLUB only feature, incompatible
with SLUB_TINY due to the memory overhead of the extra cache copies.
