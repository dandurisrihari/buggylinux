  "body": "Merge the new hardening feature to make heap spraying harder, by GONG,\nRuiqi. It creates multiple (16) copies of kmalloc caches, reducing the\nchance of an attacker-controllable allocation site to land in the same\nslab as e.g.  an allocation site with use-after-free vulnerability. The\nselection of the copy is derived from the allocation site address,\nincluding a per-boot random seed.\n\nIn line with SLAB deprecation, this is a SLUB only feature, incompatible\nwith SLUB_TINY due to the memory overhead of the extra cache copies.",
