Full commit message:
Merge tag 'bcachefs-2024-04-22' of https://evilpiepirate.org/git/bcachefs

Pull bcachefs fixes from Kent Overstreet:
 "Nothing too crazy in this one, and it looks like (fingers crossed) the
  recovery and repair issues are settling down - although there's going
  to be a long tail there, as we've still yet to really ramp up on error
  injection or syzbot.

   - fix a few more deadlocks in recovery

   - fix u32/u64 issues in mi_btree_bitmap

   - btree key cache shrinker now actually frees, with more
     instrumentation coming so we can verify that it's working
     correctly more easily in the future"
