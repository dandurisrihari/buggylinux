  "body": "Create a sub-driver for the FPGA Card BMC in order to support secure\nupdates.  This patch creates the Max10 BMC Secure Update driver and\nprovides sysfs files for displaying the root entry hashes (REH) for the\nFPGA static region (SR), the FPGA Partial Reconfiguration (PR) region,\nand the card BMC.\n\nThe Intel MAX10 BMC Root of Trust (RoT) requires that all BMC Nios firmware\nand FPGA images are authenticated using ECDSA before loading and executing\non the card. Code Signing Keys (CSK) are used to sign images. CSKs are\nsigned by a root key. The root entry hash is created from the root public\nkey.\n\nThe RoT provides authentication by storing an REH bitstream to a write-once\nlocation. Image signatures are verified against the hash.\n\nReviewed-by: Tom Rix <trix@redhat.com>\nTested-by: Tianfei Zhang <tianfei.zhang@intel.com>\nSigned-off-by: Russ Weight <russell.h.weight@intel.com>\nLink: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20220606160038.846236-3-russell.h.weight@intel.com\nSigned-off-by: Xu Yilun <yilun.xu@intel.com>",
