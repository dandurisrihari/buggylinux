Full commit message:
hardening: Enable KFENCE in the hardening config

KFENCE is not a security mitigation mechanism (due to sampling), but has
the performance characteristics of unintrusive hardening techniques.
When used at scale, however, it improves overall security by allowing
kernel developers to detect heap memory-safety bugs cheaply.
