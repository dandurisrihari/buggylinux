    ext4: fix race in buffer_head read fault injection
    
    When I enabled ext4 debug for fault injection testing, I encountered the
    following warning:
    
      EXT4-fs error (device sda): ext4_read_inode_bitmap:201: comm fsstress:
             Cannot read inode bitmap - block_group = 8, inode_bitmap = 1051
      WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 511 at fs/buffer.c:1181 mark_buffer_dirty+0x1b3/0x1d0
    
    The root cause of the issue lies in the improper implementation of ext4's
    buffer_head read fault injection. The actual completion of buffer_head
    read and the buffer_head fault injection are not atomic, which can lead
    to the uptodate flag being cleared on normally used buffer_heads in race
    conditions.

    The best approach would be to perform fault injection in the IO completion
    callback function, rather than after IO completion. However, the IO
    completion callback function cannot get the fault injection code in sb.
    
    Fix it by passing the result of fault injection into the bh read function,
    we simulate faults within the bh read function itself. This requires adding
    an extra parameter to the bh read functions that need fault injection.
