Full commit message:
docs: kernel_abi.py: fix command injection

The kernel-abi directive passes its argument straight to the shell.
This is unfortunate and unnecessary.

Let's always use paths relative to $srctree/Documentation/ and use
subprocess.check_call() instead of subprocess.Popen(shell=True).

This also makes the code shorter.
