KVM/ARM Changes for v4.7 take 2

"The GIC is dead; Long live the GIC"

This set of changes include the new vgic, which is a reimplementation of
our horribly broken legacy vgic implementation.  The two implementations
will live side-by-side (with the new being the configured default) for
one kernel release and then we'll remove it.

Also fixes a non-critical issue with virtual abort injection to guests.
