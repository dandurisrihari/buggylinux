    Merge tag 'kvm-arm-for-4-7-take2' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/kvmarm/kvmarm into kvm-next
    
    KVM/ARM Changes for v4.7 take 2
    
    "The GIC is dead; Long live the GIC"
    
    This set of changes include the new vgic, which is a reimplementation of
    our horribly broken legacy vgic implementation.  The two implementations
    will live side-by-side (with the new being the configured default) for
    one kernel release and then we'll remove it.
    
    Also fixes a non-critical issue with virtual abort injection to guests.
