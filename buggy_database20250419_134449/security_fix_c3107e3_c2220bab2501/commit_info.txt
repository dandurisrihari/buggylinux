Merge tag 'please-pull-apei' into x86/ras

APEI is currently implemented so that it depends on x86 hardware.
The primary dependency is that GHES uses the x86 NMI for hardware
error notification and MCE for memory error handling. These patches
remove that dependency.

Other APEI features such as error reporting via external IRQ, error
serialization, or error injection, do not require changes to use them
on non-x86 architectures.

The following patch set eliminates the APEI Kconfig x86 dependency
by making these changes:
- treat NMI notification as GHES architecture - HAVE_ACPI_APEI_NMI
- group and wrap around #ifdef CONFIG_HAVE_ACPI_APEI_NMI code which
  is used only for NMI path
- identify architectural boxes and abstract it accordingly (tlb flush and MCE)
- rework ioremap for both IRQ and NMI context

NMI code is kept in ghes.c file since NMI and IRQ context are tightly coupled.

Note, these patches introduce no functional changes for x86. The NMI notification
feature is hard selected for x86. Architectures that want to use this
feature should also provide NMI code infrastructure.
