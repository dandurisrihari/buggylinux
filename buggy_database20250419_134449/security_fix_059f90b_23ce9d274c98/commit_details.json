  "body": "Previous logic in the NFS mount parsing code path assumed\nauth_flavor_len was set to zero for simple authentication flavors\n(like AUTH_UNIX), and 1 for compound flavors (like AUTH_GSS).\n\nAt some earlier point (maybe even before the option parsers were\nmerged?) specific checks for auth_flavor_len being zero were removed\nfrom the functions that validate the mount option that sets the mount\npoint's authentication flavor.\n\nSince we are populating an array for authentication flavors, the\nauth_flavor_len should always be set to the number of flavors.  Let's\neliminate some cleverness here, and prepare for new logic that needs\nto know the number of flavors in the auth_flavors[] array.\n\n(auth_flavors[] is an array because at some point we want to allow a\nlist of acceptable authentication flavors to be specified via the sec=\nmount option.  For now it remains a single element array).\n\nSigned-off-by: Chuck Lever <chuck.lever@oracle.com>\nSigned-off-by: Trond Myklebust <Trond.Myklebust@netapp.com>",
