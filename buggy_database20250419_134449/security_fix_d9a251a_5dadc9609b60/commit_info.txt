Full commit message:
ASoC: SOF: ipc-msg-injector: Propagate write errors correctly

This code is supposed to propagate errors from simple_write_to_buffer()
or return -EFAULT if "size != count".  However "size" needs to be signed
for the code to work correctly and the case where "size == 0" is not
handled correctly.

Fixes: 066c67624d8c ("ASoC: SOF: ipc-msg-injector: Add support for IPC4 messages")
Fixes: 2f0b1b013bbc ("ASoC: SOF: debug: Add support for IPC message injection")
