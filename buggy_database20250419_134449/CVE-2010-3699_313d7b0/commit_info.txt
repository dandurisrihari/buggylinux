Full commit message:
blkback: Fix CVE-2010-3699

A guest can cause the backend driver to leak a kernel thread. Such
leaked threads hold references to the device, whichmakes the device
impossible to tear down. If shut down, the guest remains a zombie
domain, the xenwatch process hangs, and most xm commands will stop
working.

This patch tries to do the following for blkback:
    - identify/extract idempotent teardown operations,
    - add/move the invocation of said teardown operation
      right before we're about to allocate new resources in the
      Connected states.
