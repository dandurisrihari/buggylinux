  "body": "A guest can cause the backend driver to leak a kernel thread. Such\nleaked threads hold references to the device, whichmakes the device\nimpossible to tear down. If shut down, the guest remains a zombie\ndomain, the xenwatch process hangs, and most xm commands will stop\nworking.\n\nThis patch tries to do the following for blkback:\n    - identify/extract idempotent teardown operations,\n    - add/move the invocation of said teardown operation\n      right before we're about to allocate new resources in the\n      Connected states.\n\n[ linux-2.6.18-xen.hg 59f097ef181b ]\n\nSigned-off-by: Laszlo Ersek <lersek@redhat.com>\nSigned-off-by: Keir Fraser <keir@xen.org>\nSigned-off-by: Jeremy Fitzhardinge <jeremy.fitzhardinge@citrix.com>",
