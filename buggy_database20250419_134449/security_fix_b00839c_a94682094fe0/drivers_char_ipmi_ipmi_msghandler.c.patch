    ipmi: refactor deprecated strncpy
    
    `strncpy` is deprecated for use on NUL-terminated destination strings [1].
    
    In this case, strncpy is being used specifically for its NUL-padding
    behavior (and has been commented as such). Moreover, the destination
    string is not required to be NUL-terminated [2].
    
    We can use a more robust and less ambiguous interface in
    `memcpy_and_pad` which makes the code more readable and even eliminates
    the need for that comment.
    
    Let's also use `strnlen` instead of `strlen()` with an upper-bounds
    check as this is intrinsically a part of `strnlen`.
    
    Also included in this patch is a simple 1:1 change of `strncpy` to
    `strscpy` for ipmi_ssif.c. If NUL-padding is wanted here as well then we
    should opt again for `strscpy_pad`.
