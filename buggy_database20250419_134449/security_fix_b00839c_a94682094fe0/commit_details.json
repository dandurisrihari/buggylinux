  "body": "`strncpy` is deprecated for use on NUL-terminated destination strings [1].\n\nIn this case, strncpy is being used specifically for its NUL-padding\nbehavior (and has been commented as such). Moreover, the destination\nstring is not required to be NUL-terminated [2].\n\nWe can use a more robust and less ambiguous interface in\n`memcpy_and_pad` which makes the code more readable and even eliminates\nthe need for that comment.\n\nLet's also use `strnlen` instead of `strlen()` with an upper-bounds\ncheck as this is intrinsically a part of `strnlen`.\n\nAlso included in this patch is a simple 1:1 change of `strncpy` to\n`strscpy` for ipmi_ssif.c. If NUL-padding is wanted here as well then we\nshould opt again for `strscpy_pad`.\n\nLink: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#strncpy-on-nul-terminated-strings [1]\nLink: https://lore.kernel.org/all/ZQEADYBl0uZ1nX60@mail.minyard.net/ [2]\nLink: https://github.com/KSPP/linux/issues/90\nCc: linux-hardening@vger.kernel.org\nCc: Kees Cook <keescook@chromium.org>\nSigned-off-by: Justin Stitt <justinstitt@google.com>\nMessage-Id: <20230913-strncpy-drivers-char-ipmi-ipmi-v2-1-e3bc0f6e599f@google.com>\nSigned-off-by: Corey Minyard <minyard@acm.org>",
