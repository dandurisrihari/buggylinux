Merge branch 'timers-core-for-linus' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tip/tip

Pull timer updates from Thomas Gleixner:
 "The time/timekeeping/timer folks deliver with this update:

   - Fix a reintroduced signed/unsigned issue and cleanup the whole
     signed/unsigned mess in the timekeeping core so this wont happen
     accidentaly again.

   - Add a new trace clock based on boot time

   - Prevent injection of random sleep times when PM tracing abuses the
     RTC for storage

   - Make posix timers configurable for real tiny systems

   - Add tracepoints for the alarm timer subsystem so timer based
     suspend wakeups can be instrumented

   - The usual pile of fixes and updates to core and drivers"
