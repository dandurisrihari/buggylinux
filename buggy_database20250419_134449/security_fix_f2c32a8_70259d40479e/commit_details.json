  "body": "Most Wolfson Arizona class audio hub CODECs include a flexible ultra low\npower accessory detection subsystem. This driver exposes initial support\nfor this subsystem via the Extcon framework, implementing support for\nultra low power detection of headphone and headset with the ability to\ndetect the polarity of a headset.\n\nThe functionality of the devices is much richer and more flexible than\nthe current driver, future patches will extend the features of the\ndriver to more fully exploit this.\n\nSigned-off-by: Mark Brown <broonie@opensource.wolfsonmicro.com>\nSigned-off-by: Greg Kroah-Hartman <gregkh@linuxfoundation.org>",
