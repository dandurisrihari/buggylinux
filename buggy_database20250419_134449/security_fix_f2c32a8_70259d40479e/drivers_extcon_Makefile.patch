    Extcon: Arizona: Add driver for Wolfson Arizona class devices
    
    Most Wolfson Arizona class audio hub CODECs include a flexible ultra low
    power accessory detection subsystem. This driver exposes initial support
    for this subsystem via the Extcon framework, implementing support for
    ultra low power detection of headphone and headset with the ability to
    detect the polarity of a headset.
    
    The functionality of the devices is much richer and more flexible than
    the current driver, future patches will extend the features of the
    driver to more fully exploit this.
