    KVM: x86: Differentiate Soft vs. Hard IRQs vs. reinjected in tracepoint
    
    In the IRQ injection tracepoint, differentiate between Hard IRQs and Soft
    "IRQs", i.e. interrupts that are reinjected after incomplete delivery of
    a software interrupt from an INTn instruction.  Tag reinjected interrupts
    as such, even though the information is usually redundant since soft
    interrupts are only ever reinjected by KVM.  Though rare in practice, a
    hard IRQ can be reinjected.
