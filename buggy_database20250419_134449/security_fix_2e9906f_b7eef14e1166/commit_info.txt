Full commit message:
tracing: Add "(fault)" name injection to kernel probes

Have the specific functions for kernel probes that read strings to inject
the "(fault)" name directly. trace_probes.c does this too (for uprobes)
but as the code to read strings are going to be used by synthetic events
(and perhaps other utilities), it simplifies the code by making sure those
other uses do not need to implement the "(fault)" name injection as well.
