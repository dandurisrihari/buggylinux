Full commit message:
Merge branch 'for-linus' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/viro/vfs

Pull vfs fixes from Al Viro:
 "Assorted fixes.

  Some of that is only a matter with fault injection (broken handling of
  small allocation failure in various mount-related places), but the
  last one is a root-triggerable stack overflow, and combined with
  userns it gets really nasty ;-/"

* 'for-linus' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/viro/vfs:
  Don't leak MNT_INTERNAL away from internal mounts
  mm,vmscan: Allow preallocating memory for register_shrinker().
  rpc_pipefs: fix double-dput()
  orangefs_kill_sb(): deal with allocation failures
  jffs2_kill_sb(): deal with failed allocations
  hypfs_kill_super(): deal with failed allocations
