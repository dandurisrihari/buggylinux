Full commit message:
brcmfmac: Fix authentication latency caused by OBSS stats survey

Auto Channel Select feature of HostAP uses dump_survey to fetch
OBSS statistics. When the device is in the middle of an authentication
sequence or just at the end of authentication completion, running
dump_survey would trigger a channel change. The channel change in-turn
can cause packet loss, resulting in authentication delay. With this change,
dump_survey won't be run when authentication or association is in progress,
hence resolving the issue.
