Full commit message:
s390/archrandom: add parameter check for s390_arch_random_generate

A review of the code showed, that this function which is exposed
within the whole kernel should do a parameter check for the
amount of bytes requested. If this requested bytes is too high
an unsigned int overflow could happen causing this function to
try to memcpy a really big memory chunk.

This is not a security issue as there are only two invocations
of this function from arch/s390/include/asm/archrandom.h and both
are not exposed to userland.
