Full commit message:
Merge branch 'for-next' of git://git.samba.org/sfrench/cifs-2.6

Pull cifs updates from Steve French:
 "Various CIFS/SMB2/SMB3 updates for 3.11.  Includes bug fixes - SMB3
  support should be much more stable with key DFS fix and also signing
  possible now (although is more work to do to get SMB3 signing working
  well with multiuser).

  Mounts using the new SMB 3.02 dialect can now be done (specify
  "vers=3.02" on mount) against the most current Microsoft systems.

  Also includes a big cleanup of the cifs/smb2/smb3 authentication code
  from Jeff which fixes some long standing problems with the way allowed
  authentication flavors and signing are configured.

  Some followon patches later in the cycle will clean up allocation of
  structures for the various security mechanisms depending on what
  dialect is chosen (reduces memory usage a little) and to add support
  for the secure negotiate fsctl (for smb3) which prevents downgrade
  attacks."
