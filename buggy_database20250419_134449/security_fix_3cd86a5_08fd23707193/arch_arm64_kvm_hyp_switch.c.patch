    Merge tag 'arm64-upstream' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/arm64/linux
    
    Pull arm64 updates from Catalin Marinas:
     "The bulk is in-kernel pointer authentication, activity monitors and
      lots of asm symbol annotations. I also queued the sys_mremap() patch
      commenting the asymmetry in the address untagging.
    
      Summary:
    
       - In-kernel Pointer Authentication support (previously only offered
         to user space).
    
       - ARM Activity Monitors (AMU) extension support allowing better CPU
         utilisation numbers for the scheduler (frequency invariance).
    
       - Memory hot-remove support for arm64.
    
       - Lots of asm annotations (SYM_*) in preparation for the in-kernel
         Branch Target Identification (BTI) support.
    
       - arm64 perf updates: ARMv8.5-PMU 64-bit counters, refactoring the
         PMU init callbacks, support for new DT compatibles.
    
       - IPv6 header checksum optimisation.
    
       - Fixes: SDEI (software delegated exception interface) double-lock on
         hibernate with shared events.
    
       - Minor clean-ups and refactoring: cpu_ops accessor,
         cpu_do_switch_mm() converted to C, cpufeature finalisation helper.
    
       - sys_mremap() comment explaining the asymmetric address untagging
         behaviour"
