    fs: Give dentry to inode_change_ok() instead of inode
    
    inode_change_ok() will be resposible for clearing capabilities and IMA
    extended attributes and as such will need dentry. Give it as an argument
    to inode_change_ok() instead of an inode. Also rename inode_change_ok()
    to setattr_prepare() to better relect that it does also some
    modifications in addition to checks.
