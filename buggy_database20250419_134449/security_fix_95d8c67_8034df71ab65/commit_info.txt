Full commit message:
Merge tag 'drm-msm-next-2022-09-22' of https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/msm into drm-next

msm-next for v6.1

DPU:
- simplified VBIF configuration
- cleaned up CTL interfaces to accept indices rather than flush masks

DSI:
- removed unused msm_display_dsc_config struct
- switch regulator calls to new bulk API
- switched to use PANEL_BRIDGE for directly attached panels

DSI PHY:
- converted drivers to use parent_hws instead of parent_names

DP:
- cleaned up pixel_rate handling

HDMI PHY:
- turned hdmi-phy-8996 into OF clk provider

core:
- misc dt-bindings fixes
- choose eDP as primary display if it's available
- support getting interconnects from either the mdss or the mdp5/dpu
  device nodes

gpu+gem:
- Shrinker + LRU re-work:
  - adds a shared GEM LRU+shrinker helper and moves msm over to that
  - reduces lock contention between retire and submit by avoiding the
    need to acquire obj lock in retire path (and instead using resv
    seeing obj's busyness in the shrinker
  - fix reclaim vs submit issues
- GEM fault injection for triggering userspace error paths
- Map/unmap optimization
- Improved robustness for a6xx GPU recovery
