    Merge tag 'drm-msm-next-2022-09-22' of https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/msm into drm-next
    
    msm-next for v6.1
    
    DPU:
    - simplified VBIF configuration
    - cleaned up CTL interfaces to accept indices rather than flush masks
    
    DSI:
    - removed unused msm_display_dsc_config struct
    - switch regulator calls to new bulk API
    - switched to use PANEL_BRIDGE for directly attached panels
    
    DSI PHY:
    - converted drivers to use parent_hws instead of parent_names
    
    DP:
    - cleaned up pixel_rate handling
    
    HDMI PHY:
    - turned hdmi-phy-8996 into OF clk provider
    
    core:
    - misc dt-bindings fixes
    - choose eDP as primary display if it's available
    - support getting interconnects from either the mdss or the mdp5/dpu
      device nodes
    
    gpu+gem:
    - Shrinker + LRU re-work:
      - adds a shared GEM LRU+shrinker helper and moves msm over to that
      - reduces lock contention between retire and submit by avoiding the
        need to acquire obj lock in retire path (and instead using resv
        seeing obj's busyness in the shrinker
      - fix reclaim vs submit issues
    - GEM fault injection for triggering userspace error paths
    - Map/unmap optimization
    - Improved robustness for a6xx GPU recovery
