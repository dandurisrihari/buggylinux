  "body": "[Why]\nSome displays have an issue where the hdcp chips are initialized after the\ndisplay has already lit up. This means we can sometimes authentication too early\nand cause authentication failures.\n\nThis happens when HDCP is enabled and the display is power cycled. Normally we\nwill authenticate 2 seconds after the display is lit, but some displays need a\nbit more time.\n\n[How]\nIncrease delay to 3 second before we start authentication.\n\nSigned-off-by: Bhawanpreet Lakha <Bhawanpreet.Lakha@amd.com>\nReviewed-by: Nicholas Kazlauskas <nicholas.kazlauskas@amd.com>\nSigned-off-by: Alex Deucher <alexander.deucher@amd.com>",
