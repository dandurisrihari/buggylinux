Full commit message:
usb: gadget: u_ether: replace deprecated strncpy with strscpy

strncpy() is deprecated for use on NUL-terminated destination strings
[1] and as such we should prefer more robust and less ambiguous string
interfaces.

Let's use the new 2-argument strscpy() as this guarantees
NUL-termination on the destination buffer and also uses the destination
buffer's size to bound the operation.
