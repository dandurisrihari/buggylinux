Merge branch kvm-arm64/misc into kvmarm/next

* kvm-arm64/misc:
  : Miscellaneous updates
  :
  :  - Avoid trapping CTR_EL0 on systems with FEAT_EVT, as the register is
  :    commonly read by userspace
  :
  :  - Make use of FEAT_BTI at hyp stage-1, setting the Guard Page bit to 1
  :    for executable mappings
  :
  :  - Use a separate set of pointer authentication keys for the hypervisor
  :    when running in protected mode (i.e. pKVM)
  :
  :  - Plug a few holes in timer initialization where KVM fails to free the
  :    timer IRQ(s)
  KVM: arm64: Use different pointer authentication keys for pKVM
  KVM: arm64: timers: Fix resource leaks in kvm_timer_hyp_init()
  KVM: arm64: Use BTI for nvhe
  KVM: arm64: Relax trapping of CTR_EL0 when FEAT_EVT is available
