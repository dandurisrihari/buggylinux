    Merge branch kvm-arm64/misc into kvmarm/next
    
    * kvm-arm64/misc:
      : Miscellaneous updates
      :
      :  - Avoid trapping CTR_EL0 on systems with FEAT_EVT, as the register is
      :    commonly read by userspace
      :
      :  - Make use of FEAT_BTI at hyp stage-1, setting the Guard Page bit to 1
      :    for executable mappings
      :
      :  - Use a separate set of pointer authentication keys for the hypervisor
      :    when running in protected mode (i.e. pKVM)
      :
      :  - Plug a few holes in timer initialization where KVM fails to free the
      :    timer IRQ(s)
      KVM: arm64: Use different pointer authentication keys for pKVM
      KVM: arm64: timers: Fix resource leaks in kvm_timer_hyp_init()
      KVM: arm64: Use BTI for nvhe
      KVM: arm64: Relax trapping of CTR_EL0 when FEAT_EVT is available
