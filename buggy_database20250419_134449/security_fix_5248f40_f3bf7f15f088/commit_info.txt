Full commit message:
binfmt: replace deprecated strncpy

strncpy() is deprecated for use on NUL-terminated destination strings
[1] and as such we should prefer more robust and less ambiguous string
interfaces.

There is a _nearly_ identical implementation of fill_psinfo present in
binfmt_elf.c -- except that one uses get_task_comm over strncpy(). Let's
mirror that in binfmt_elf_fdpic.c
