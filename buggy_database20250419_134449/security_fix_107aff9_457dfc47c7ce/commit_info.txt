Merge tag 'staging-5.5-rc3' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/staging

Pull staging driver fixes from Greg KH:
 "Here are some small staging driver fixes for a number of reported
  issues.

  The majority here are some fixes for the wfx driver, but also in here
  is a comedi driver fix found during some code review, and an axis-fifo
  build dependancy issue to resolve some reported testing problems.

  All of these have been in linux-next with no reported issues"
