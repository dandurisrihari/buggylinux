-	 * Reqs with at_head or passthrough flags set are to be put
-	 * directly into dispatch list. Additional case for putting rq
-	 * directly into the dispatch queue: the only active
-	 * bfq_queues are bfqq and either its waker bfq_queue or one
-	 * of its woken bfq_queues. The rationale behind this
-	 * additional condition is as follows:
-	 * - consider a bfq_queue, say Q1, detected as a waker of
-	 *   another bfq_queue, say Q2
-	 * - by definition of a waker, Q1 blocks the I/O of Q2, i.e.,
-	 *   some I/O of Q1 needs to be completed for new I/O of Q2
-	 *   to arrive.  A notable example of waker is journald
-	 * - so, Q1 and Q2 are in any respect the queues of two
-	 *   cooperating processes (or of two cooperating sets of
-	 *   processes): the goal of Q1's I/O is doing what needs to
-	 *   be done so that new Q2's I/O can finally be
-	 *   issued. Therefore, if the service of Q1's I/O is delayed,
-	 *   then Q2's I/O is delayed too.  Conversely, if Q2's I/O is
-	 *   delayed, the goal of Q1's I/O is hindered.
-	 * - as a consequence, if some I/O of Q1/Q2 arrives while
-	 *   Q2/Q1 is the only queue in service, there is absolutely
-	 *   no point in delaying the service of such an I/O. The
-	 *   only possible result is a throughput loss
-	 * - so, when the above condition holds, the best option is to
-	 *   have the new I/O dispatched as soon as possible
-	 * - the most effective and efficient way to attain the above
-	 *   goal is to put the new I/O directly in the dispatch
-	 *   list
-	 * - as an additional restriction, Q1 and Q2 must be the only
-	 *   busy queues for this commit to put the I/O of Q2/Q1 in
-	 *   the dispatch list.  This is necessary, because, if also
-	 *   other queues are waiting for service, then putting new
-	 *   I/O directly in the dispatch list may evidently cause a
-	 *   violation of service guarantees for the other queues
