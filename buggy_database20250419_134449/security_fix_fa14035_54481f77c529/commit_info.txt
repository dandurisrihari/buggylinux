====================
rxrpc: Fixes and adjustments

This set of patches contains some fixes and adjustments:

 (1) Connections for exclusive calls are being reused because the check to
     work out whether to set RXRPC_CONN_DONT_REUSE is checking where the
     parameters will be copied to (but haven't yet).

 (2) Make Tx loss-injection go through the normal return, so the state gets
     set correctly for what the code thinks it has done.

     Note lost Tx packets in the tx_data trace rather than the skb
     tracepoint.

 (3) Activate channels according to the current state from within the
     channel_lock to avoid someone changing it on us.

 (4) Reduce the local endpoint's services list to a single pointer as we
     don't allow service AF_RXRPC sockets to share UDP ports with other
     AF_RXRPC sockets, so there can't be more than one element in the list.

 (5) Request more ACKs in slow-start mode to help monitor the state driving
     the window configuration.

 (6) Display the serial number of the packet being ACK'd rather than the
     ACK packet's own serial number in the congestion trace as this can be
     related to other entries in the trace.
