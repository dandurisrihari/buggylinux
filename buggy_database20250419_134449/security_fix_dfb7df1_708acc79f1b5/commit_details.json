The destination buffer db_root is only used with \"%s\"\nformat strings and must therefore be NUL-terminated, but not NUL-padded.\n\nUse scnprintf() because snprintf() could return a value >= DB_ROOT_LEN\nand lead to an out-of-bounds access. This doesn't happen because count\nis explicitly checked against DB_ROOT_LEN before. However, scnprintf()\nalways returns the number of characters actually written to the string\nbuffer, which is always within the bounds of db_root_stage, and should\nbe preferred over snprintf().\n\nThe size parameter of strscpy() is optional and since DB_ROOT_LEN is the\nsize of the destination buffer, it can be removed.
