    Merge patch series "riscv: Add support for xtheadvector"
    
    Charlie Jenkins <charlie@rivosinc.com> says:
    
    xtheadvector is a custom extension that is based upon riscv vector
    version 0.7.1 [1]. All of the vector routines have been modified to
    support this alternative vector version based upon whether xtheadvector
    was determined to be supported at boot.
    
    vlenb is not supported on the existing xtheadvector hardware, so a
    devicetree property thead,vlenb is added to provide the vlenb to Linux.
    
    There is a new hwprobe key RISCV_HWPROBE_KEY_VENDOR_EXT_THEAD_0 that is
    used to request which thead vendor extensions are supported on the
    current platform. This allows future vendors to allocate hwprobe keys
    for their vendor.
    
    Support for xtheadvector is also added to the vector kselftests.
