     "ARM:
       - VHE optimizations
    
       - EL2 address space randomization
    
       - speculative execution mitigations ("variant 3a", aka execution past
         invalid privilege register access)
    
       - bugfixes and cleanups
    
      PPC:
       - improvements for the radix page fault handler for HV KVM on POWER9
    
      s390:
       - more kvm stat counters
    
       - virtio gpu plumbing
    
       - documentation
    
       - facilities improvements
    
      x86:
       - support for VMware magic I/O port and pseudo-PMCs
    
       - AMD pause loop exiting
    
       - support for AMD core performance extensions
    
       - support for synchronous register access
    
       - expose nVMX capabilities to userspace
    
       - support for Hyper-V signaling via eventfd
    
       - use Enlightened VMCS when running on Hyper-V
    
       - allow userspace to disable MWAIT/HLT/PAUSE vmexits
    
       - usual roundup of optimizations and nested virtualization bugfixes
    
      Generic:
       - API selftest infrastructure (though the only tests are for x86 as
         of now)"
