Full commit message:
hardening: Move BUG_ON_DATA_CORRUPTION to hardening options

BUG_ON_DATA_CORRUPTION is turning detected corruptions of list data
structures from WARNings into BUGs. This can be useful to stop further
corruptions or even exploitation attempts.

However, the option has less to do with debugging than with hardening.
With the introduction of LIST_HARDENED, it makes more sense to move it
to the hardening options, where it selects LIST_HARDENED instead.

Without this change, combining BUG_ON_DATA_CORRUPTION with LIST_HARDENED
alone wouldn't be possible, because DEBUG_LIST would always be selected
by BUG_ON_DATA_CORRUPTION.
