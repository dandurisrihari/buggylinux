Full commit message:
drivers: misc: ti-st: replace deprecated strncpy with strscpy

`strncpy` is deprecated for use on NUL-terminated destination strings
[1] and as such we should prefer more robust and less ambiguous string
interfaces.

We expect both `kim_data->dev_name` and `kim_gdata->dev_name` to be
NUL-terminated.

`kim_data->dev_name` seems to not require NUL-padding.

`kim_gdata` is already zero-allocated and as such does not require
NUL-padding:
|       kim_gdata = kzalloc(sizeof(struct kim_data_s), GFP_KERNEL);

Considering the above, a suitable replacement is `strscpy` [2] due to
the fact that it guarantees NUL-termination on the destination buffer
without unnecessarily NUL-padding.

Let's also opt to use the more idiomatic strscpy usage of:
strscpy(dest, src, sizeof(dest))
