Full commit message:
fs-verity: support builtin file signatures

To meet some users' needs, add optional support for having fs-verity
handle a portion of the authentication policy in the kernel.  An
".fs-verity" keyring is created to which X.509 certificates can be
added; then a sysctl 'fs.verity.require_signatures' can be set to cause
the kernel to enforce that all fs-verity files contain a signature of
their file measurement by a key in this keyring.

See the "Built-in signature verification" section of
Documentation/filesystems/fsverity.rst for the full documentation.
