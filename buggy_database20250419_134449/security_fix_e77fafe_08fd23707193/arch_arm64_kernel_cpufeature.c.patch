    Merge tag 'arm64-upstream' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/arm64/linux
    
    Pull arm64 updates from Will Deacon:
     "Although there isn't tonnes of code in terms of line count, there are
      a fair few headline features which I've noted both in the tag and also
      in the merge commits when I pulled everything together.
    
      The part I'm most pleased with is that we had 35 contributors this
      time around, which feels like a big jump from the usual small group of
      core arm64 arch developers. Hopefully they all enjoyed it so much that
      they'll continue to contribute, but we'll see.
    
      It's probably worth highlighting that we've pulled in a branch from
      the risc-v folks which moves our CPU topology code out to where it can
      be shared with others.
    
      Summary:
    
       - 52-bit virtual addressing in the kernel
    
       - New ABI to allow tagged user pointers to be dereferenced by
         syscalls
    
       - Early RNG seeding by the bootloader
    
       - Improve robustness of SMP boot
    
       - Fix TLB invalidation in light of recent architectural
         clarifications
    
       - Support for i.MX8 DDR PMU
    
       - Remove direct LSE instruction patching in favour of static keys
    
       - Function error injection using kprobes
    
       - Support for the PPTT "thread" flag introduced by ACPI 6.3
    
       - Move PSCI idle code into proper cpuidle driver
    
       - Relaxation of implicit I/O memory barriers
    
       - Build with RELR relocations when toolchain supports them
    
       - Numerous cleanups and non-critical fixes"
