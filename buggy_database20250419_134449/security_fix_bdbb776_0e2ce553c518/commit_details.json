  "body": "It was possible to extract the robust list head address from a setuid\nprocess if it had used set_robust_list(), allowing an ASLR info leak. This\nchanges the permission checks to be the same as those used for similar\ninfo that comes out of /proc.\n\nRunning a setuid program that uses robust futexes would have had:\n  cred->euid != pcred->euid\n  cred->euid == pcred->uid\nso the old permissions check would allow it. I'm not aware of any setuid\nprograms that use robust futexes, so this is just a preventative measure.\n\n(This patch is based on changes from grsecurity.)\n\nSigned-off-by: Kees Cook <keescook@chromium.org>\nCc: Darren Hart <dvhart@linux.intel.com>\nCc: Peter Zijlstra <a.p.zijlstra@chello.nl>\nCc: Jiri Kosina <jkosina@suse.cz>\nCc: Eric W.
