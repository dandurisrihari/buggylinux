Full commit message:
Documentation: In-Field Scan

Add documentation for In-Field Scan (IFS). This documentation
describes the basics of IFS, the loading IFS image, chunk
authentication, running scan and how to check result via sysfs.

The CORE_CAPABILITIES MSR enumerates whether IFS is supported.

The full  github location for distributing the IFS images is
still being decided. So just a placeholder included for now
in the documentation.

Future CPUs will support more than one type of test. Plan for
that now by using a "_0" suffix on the ABI directory names.
Additional test types will use "_1", etc.
