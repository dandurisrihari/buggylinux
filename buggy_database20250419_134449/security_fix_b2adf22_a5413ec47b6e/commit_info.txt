Full commit message:
smb3: on reconnect set PreviousSessionId field

The server detects reconnect by the (non-zero) value in PreviousSessionId
of SMB2/SMB3 SessionSetup request, but this behavior regressed due
to commit 166cea4dc3a4f66f020cfb9286225ecd228ab61d
("SMB2: Separate RawNTLMSSP authentication from SMB2_sess_setup")
