Full commit message:
fault-injection: allow stacktrace filter for x86-64

This patchset allow fault injection to run on x86_64 and makes stacktrace
filter work as expected.  With this, we can test a device driver module
with fault injection more easily.


This patch (of 4):

FAULT_INJECTION_STACKTRACE_FILTER option was apparently disallowed on
x86_64 because of problems with the stack unwinder:

        fault injection: disable stacktrace filter for x86-64

However, there is no problems whatsoever with this today. Let's allow
it again.
