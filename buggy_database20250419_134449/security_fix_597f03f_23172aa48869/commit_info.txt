Merge branch 'smp-hotplug-for-linus' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tip/tip

Pull CPU hotplug updates from Thomas Gleixner:
 "Yet another batch of cpu hotplug core updates and conversions:

   - Provide core infrastructure for multi instance drivers so the
     drivers do not have to keep custom lists.

   - Convert custom lists to the new infrastructure. The block-mq custom
     list conversion comes through the block tree and makes the diffstat
     tip over to more lines removed than added.

   - Handle unbalanced hotplug enable/disable calls more gracefully.

   - Remove the obsolete CPU_STARTING/DYING notifier support.

   - Convert another batch of notifier users.

   The relayfs changes which conflicted with the conversion have been
   shipped to me by Andrew.

   The remaining lot is targeted for 4.10 so that we finally can remove
   the rest of the notifiers"
