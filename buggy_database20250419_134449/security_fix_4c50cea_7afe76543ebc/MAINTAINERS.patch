    Pull libnvdimm fixes from Dan Williams:
     "A regression fix, new unit test infrastructure and a build fix:
    
       - Regression fix addressing support for the new NVDIMM label storage
         area access commands (_LSI, _LSR, and _LSW).
    
         The Intel specific version of these commands communicated the
         "Device Locked" status on the label-storage-information command.
    
         However, these new commands (standardized in ACPI 6.2) communicate
         the "Device Locked" status on the label-storage-read command, and
         the driver was missing the indication.
    
         Reading from locked persistent memory is similar to reading
         unmapped PCI memory space, returns all 1's.
    
       - Unit test infrastructure is added to regression test the "Device
         Locked" detection failure.
    
       - A build fix is included to allow the "of_pmem" driver to be built
         as a module and translate an Open Firmware described device to its
         local numa node"
