    Pull networking fixes from Jakub Kicinski:
     "Including fixes from netfilter.
    
      As Paolo promised we continue to hammer out issues in our selftests.
      This is not the end but probably the peak.
    
      Current release - regressions:
    
       - smc: fix incorrect SMC-D link group matching logic
    
      Current release - new code bugs:
    
       - eth: bnxt: silence WARN() when device skips a timestamp, it happens
    
      Previous releases - regressions:
    
       - ipmr: fix null-deref when forwarding mcast packets
    
       - conntrack: evaluate window negotiation only for packets in the
         REPLY direction, otherwise SYN retransmissions trigger incorrect
         window scale negotiation
    
       - ipset: fix performance regression in swap operation
    
      Previous releases - always broken:
    
       - tcp: add sanity checks to types of pages getting into the rx
         zerocopy path, we only support basic NIC -> user, no page cache
         pages etc.
    
       - ip6_tunnel: make sure to pull inner header in __ip6_tnl_rcv()
    
       - nt_tables: more input sanitization changes
    
       - dsa: mt7530: fix 10M/100M speed on MediaTek MT7988 switch
    
       - bridge: mcast: fix loss of snooping after long uptime, jiffies do
         wrap on 32bit
    
       - xen-netback: properly sync TX responses, protect with locking
    
       - phy: mediatek-ge-soc: sync calibration values with MediaTek SDK,
         increase connection stability
    
       - eth: pds: fixes for various teardown, and reset races
    
      Misc:
    
       - hsr: silence WARN() if we can't alloc supervision frame, it
         happens"
