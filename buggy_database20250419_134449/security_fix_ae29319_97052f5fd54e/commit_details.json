  "subject": "[Bluetooth] Update authentication status after successful encryption",
  "body": "The authentication status is not communicated to both parties. This is\nactually a flaw in the Bluetooth specification. Only the requesting side\nreally knows if the authentication was successful or not. This piece of\ninformation is however needed on the other side to know if it has to\ntrigger the authentication procedure or not. Worst case is that both\nsides will request authentication at different times, but this should\nbe avoided since it costs extra time when setting up a new connection.\n\nFor Bluetooth encryption it is required to authenticate the link first\nand the encryption status is communicated to both sides. So when a link\nis switched to encryption it is possible to update the authentication\nstatus since it implies an authenticated link.\n\nSigned-off-by: Marcel Holtmann <marcel@holtmann.org>",
