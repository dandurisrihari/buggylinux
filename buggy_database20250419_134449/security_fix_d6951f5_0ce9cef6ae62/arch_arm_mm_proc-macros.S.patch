    ARM: fix the cockup in the previous patch
    
    The intention in the previous patch was to only place the processor
    tables in the .rodata section if big.Little was being built and we
    wanted the branch target hardening, but instead (due to the way it
    was tested) it ended up always placing the tables into the .rodata
    section.
    
    Although harmless, let's correct this anyway.
