Full commit message:
Merge tag 'for-linus' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/rdma/rdma

Pull rdma fixes from Doug Ledford:
 "Here's our second -rc pull request. Nothing particularly special in
  this one. The client removal deadlock fix is kindy tricky, but we had
  multiple eyes on it and no one could find a fault in it. A couple
  Spectre V1 fixes too. Otherwise, all just normal -rc fodder:

   - A couple Spectre V1 fixes (umad, hfi1)

   - Fix a tricky deadlock in the rdma core code with refcounting
     instead of locks (client removal patches)

   - Build errors (hns)

   - Fix a scheduling while atomic issue (mlx5)

   - Use after free fix (mad)

   - Fix error path return code (hns)

   - Null deref fix (siw_crypto_hash)

   - A few other misc. minor fixes"
