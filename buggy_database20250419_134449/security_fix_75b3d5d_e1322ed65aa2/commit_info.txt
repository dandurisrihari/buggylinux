Full commit message:
dax: refactor deprecated strncpy

`strncpy` is deprecated for use on NUL-terminated destination strings [1].

We should prefer more robust and less ambiguous string interfaces.

`dax_id->dev_name` is expected to be NUL-terminated and has been zero-allocated.

A suitable replacement is `strscpy` [2] due to the fact that it
guarantees NUL-termination on the destination buffer. Moreover, due to
`dax_id` being zero-allocated the padding behavior of `strncpy` is not
needed and a simple 1:1 replacement of strncpy -> strscpy should
suffice.
