Full commit message:
eeprom: idt_89hpesx: replace open-coded kmemdup_nul

A malloc + strncpy + manual NUL_termination is just kmemdup_nul. Let's use
this interface as it is less error-prone and more readable.

Also drop `csraddr_len` as it is just used in a single place and we can
just do the arithmetic in-line.
