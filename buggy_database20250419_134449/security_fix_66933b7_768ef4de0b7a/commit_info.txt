Full commit message:
KVM: s390: simplify in-kernel program irq injection

The main reason to keep program injection in kernel separated until now
was that we were able to do some checking, if really only the owning
thread injects program interrupts (via waitqueue_active(li->wq)).

This BUG_ON was never triggered and the chances of really hitting it, if
another thread injected a program irq to another vcpu, were very small.

Let's drop this check and turn kvm_s390_inject_program_int() and
kvm_s390_inject_prog_irq() into simple inline functions that makes use of
kvm_s390_inject_vcpu().

__must_check can be dropped as they are implicitely given by
kvm_s390_inject_vcpu(), to avoid ugly long function prototypes.
