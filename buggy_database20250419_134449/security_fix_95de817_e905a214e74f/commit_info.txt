Full commit message:
cfg80211: stop tracking authenticated state

To track authenticated state seems to have been
a design mistake in cfg80211. It is possible to
have out of band authentication (FT), tracking
multiple authentications caused more problems
than it ever helped, and the implementation in
mac80211 is too complex.

Remove all this complexity, and let userspace
do whatever it wants to, mac80211 can deal with
that just fine. Association is still tracked of
course, but authentication no longer is. Local
auth state changes are thus no longer of value,
so ignore them completely.

This will also help implement SAE -- asking the
driver to do an authentication is now almost
equivalent to sending an authentication frame,
with the exception of shared key authentication
which is still handled completely.
