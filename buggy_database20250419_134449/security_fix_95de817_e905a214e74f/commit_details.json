  "body": "To track authenticated state seems to have been\na design mistake in cfg80211. It is possible to\nhave out of band authentication (FT), tracking\nmultiple authentications caused more problems\nthan it ever helped, and the implementation in\nmac80211 is too complex.\n\nRemove all this complexity, and let userspace\ndo whatever it wants to, mac80211 can deal with\nthat just fine. Association is still tracked of\ncourse, but authentication no longer is. Local\nauth state changes are thus no longer of value,\nso ignore them completely.\n\nThis will also help implement SAE -- asking the\ndriver to do an authentication is now almost\nequivalent to sending an authentication frame,\nwith the exception of shared key authentication\nwhich is still handled completely.\n\nSigned-off-by: Johannes Berg <johannes.berg@intel.com>\nSigned-off-by: John W.
