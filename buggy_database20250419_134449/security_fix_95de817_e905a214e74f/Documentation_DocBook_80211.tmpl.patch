    cfg80211: stop tracking authenticated state
    
    To track authenticated state seems to have been
    a design mistake in cfg80211. It is possible to
    have out of band authentication (FT), tracking
    multiple authentications caused more problems
    than it ever helped, and the implementation in
    mac80211 is too complex.
    
    Remove all this complexity, and let userspace
    do whatever it wants to, mac80211 can deal with
    that just fine. Association is still tracked of
    course, but authentication no longer is. Local
    auth state changes are thus no longer of value,
    so ignore them completely.
    
    This will also help implement SAE -- asking the
    driver to do an authentication is now almost
    equivalent to sending an authentication frame,
    with the exception of shared key authentication
    which is still handled completely.
