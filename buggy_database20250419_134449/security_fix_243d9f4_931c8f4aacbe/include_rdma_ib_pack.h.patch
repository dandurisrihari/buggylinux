    IB/hfi1: Add transmit fault injection feature
    
    Add ability to fault packets on transmit by opcode.
    Dropping by packet can be achieved by setting the mask to 0.
    
    In order to drop non-verbs traffic we set PbcInsertHrc
    to NONE (0x2). The packet will still be delivered to
    the receiving node but a KHdrHCRCErr (KDETH packet
    with a bad HCRC) will be triggered and the packet will
    not be delivered to the correct context.
    
    In order to drop regular verbs traffic we set the
    PbcTestEbp flag. The packet will still be delivered
    to the receiving node but a 'late ebp error' will
    be triggered and will be dropped.
    
    A global toggle (/sys/kernel/debug/hfi1/hfi1_X/fault_suppress_err)
    has been added to suppress the error messages on the receive
    node when a packet was faulted on the sending node.
