Full commit message:
IB/hfi1: Add transmit fault injection feature

Add ability to fault packets on transmit by opcode.
Dropping by packet can be achieved by setting the mask to 0.

In order to drop non-verbs traffic we set PbcInsertHrc
to NONE (0x2). The packet will still be delivered to
the receiving node but a KHdrHCRCErr (KDETH packet
with a bad HCRC) will be triggered and the packet will
not be delivered to the correct context.

In order to drop regular verbs traffic we set the
PbcTestEbp flag. The packet will still be delivered
to the receiving node but a 'late ebp error' will
be triggered and will be dropped.

A global toggle (/sys/kernel/debug/hfi1/hfi1_X/fault_suppress_err)
has been added to suppress the error messages on the receive
node when a packet was faulted on the sending node.
