Otherwise, fw_fill_request could access the four\nbytes after the end of the outbound_transaction_event structure.\n\nSigned-off-by: Clemens Ladisch <clemens@ladisch.de>\n\nModification of Clemens' change:  Consolidate the check into\ninit_request() which is used by the affected ioctl_send_request() and\nioctl_send_broadcast_request() and the unaffected\nioctl_send_stream_packet(), to save a few lines of code.\n\nNote, since struct outbound_transaction_event *e is slab-allocated, such\nan out-of-bounds access won't hit unallocated memory but may result in a\n(virtually impossible to exploit) information disclosure.\n\nSigned-off-by: Stefan Richter <stefanr@s5r6.in-berlin.de>",
