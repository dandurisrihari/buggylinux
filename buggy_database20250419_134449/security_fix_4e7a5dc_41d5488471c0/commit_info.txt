Full commit message:
ceph: negotiate authentication protocol; implement AUTH_NONE protocol

When we open a monitor session, we send an initial AUTH message listing
the auth protocols we support, our entity name, and (possibly) a previously
assigned global_id.  The monitor chooses a protocol and responds with an
initial message.

Initially implement AUTH_NONE, a dummy protocol that provides no security,
but works within the new framework.  It generates 'authorizers' that are
used when connecting to (mds, osd) services that simply state our entity
name and global_id.

This is a wire protocol change.
