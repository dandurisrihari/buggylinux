Full commit message:
drm/gma500: refactor deprecated strncpy

`strncpy` is deprecated for use on NUL-terminated destination strings [1].

We should prefer more robust and less ambiguous string interfaces.

Since `chan->base.name` is expected to be NUL-terminated, a suitable
replacement is `strscpy` [2] due to the fact that it guarantees
NUL-termination on the destination buffer without also unnecessarily
NUL-padding (since `chan` is kzalloc'd already).
