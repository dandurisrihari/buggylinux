Full commit message:
nfsd: clean up comments over nfs4_client definition

nfsd fault injection has been deprecated since
commit 9d60d93198c6 ("Deprecate nfsd fault injection")
and removed by
commit e56dc9e2949e ("nfsd: remove fault injection code")

So remove the outdated parts about fault injection.
