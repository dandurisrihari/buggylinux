Merge git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/davem/net

Pull networking fixes from David Miller:

 1) Fix uninitialized struct station_info in cfg80211_wireless_stats(),
    from Johannes Berg.

 2) Revert commit attempt to fix ipv6 protocol resubmission, it adds
    regressions.

 3) Endless loops can be created in bridge port lists, fix from Nikolay
    Aleksandrov.

 4) Don't WARN_ON() if sk->sk_forward_alloc is non-zero in
    sk_clear_memalloc, it is a legal situation during swap deactivation.
    Fix from Mel Gorman.

 5) Fix order of disabling interrupts and unlocking NAPI in enic driver
    to avoid a race.  From Govindarajulu Varadarajan.

 6) High and low register writes are swapped when programming the start
    of periodic output in igb driver.  From Richard Cochran.

 7) Fix device rename handling in mpls stack, from Robert Shearman.

 8) Do not trigger compaction synchronously when optimistically trying
    to allocate an order 3 page in alloc_skb_with_frags() and
    skb_page_frag_refill().  From Shaohua Li.

 9) Authentication with COOKIE_ECHO is not handled properly in SCTP, fix
    from Marcelo Ricardo Leitner.
