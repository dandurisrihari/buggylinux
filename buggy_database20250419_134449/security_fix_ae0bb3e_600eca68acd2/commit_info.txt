KVM: VMX: Properly handle software interrupt re-injection in real mode

When reinjecting a software interrupt or exception, use the correct
instruction length provided by the hardware instead of a hardcoded 1.

Fixes problems running the suse 9.1 livecd boot loader.

Problem introduced by commit f0a3602c20 ("KVM: Move interrupt injection
logic to x86.c").
