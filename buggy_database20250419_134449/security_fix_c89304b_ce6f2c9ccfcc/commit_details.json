  "body": "The check from commit 30c2235c is incomplete and cannot prevent\ncases like key_len = 0x80000000 (INT_MAX + 1).  In that case, the\nleft-hand side of the check (INT_MAX - key_len), which is unsigned,\nbecomes 0xffffffff (UINT_MAX) and bypasses the check.\n\nHowever this shouldn't be a security issue.  The function is called\nfrom the following two code paths:\n\n 1) setsockopt()\n\n 2) sctp_auth_asoc_set_secret()\n\nIn case (1), sca_keylength is never going to exceed 65535 since it's\nbounded by a u16 from the user API.  As such, the key length will\nnever overflow.\n\nIn case (2), sca_keylength is computed based on the user key (1 short)\nand 2 * key_vector (3 shorts) for a total of 7 * USHRT_MAX, which still\nwill not overflow.\n\nIn other words, this overflow check is not really necessary.  Just\nmake it more correct.\n\nSigned-off-by: Xi Wang <xi.wang@gmail.com>\nCc: Vlad Yasevich <vladislav.yasevich@hp.com>\nSigned-off-by: David S. Miller <davem@davemloft.net>",
