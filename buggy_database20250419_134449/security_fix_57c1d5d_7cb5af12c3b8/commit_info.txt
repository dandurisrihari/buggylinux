Full commit message:
media: vivid: fix timestamp and sequence wrapping

The error injection controls that test wrap-around sequence and timestamp
counters were partially broken. Add a menu option for 64 or 32 bit signed
timestamp wrapping. Prevent the timestamp from wrapping around before the
device can be tested.  Remove the sequence count from the timestamp
calculation so that sequence wrapping does not interfere with the
timestamp.  Add consistent time and sequence wrapping to sdr and touch
devices.
