    Pull kvm updates from Paolo Bonzini:
     "ARM64:
    
       - Eager page splitting optimization for dirty logging, optionally
         allowing for a VM to avoid the cost of hugepage splitting in the
         stage-2 fault path.
    
       - Arm FF-A proxy for pKVM, allowing a pKVM host to safely interact
         with services that live in the Secure world. pKVM intervenes on
         FF-A calls to guarantee the host doesn't misuse memory donated to
         the hyp or a pKVM guest.
    
       - Support for running the split hypervisor with VHE enabled, known as
         'hVHE' mode. This is extremely useful for testing the split
         hypervisor on VHE-only systems, and paves the way for new use cases
         that depend on having two TTBRs available at EL2.
    
       - Generalized framework for configurable ID registers from userspace.
         KVM/arm64 currently prevents arbitrary CPU feature set
         configuration from userspace, but the intent is to relax this
         limitation and allow userspace to select a feature set consistent
         with the CPU.
    
       - Enable the use of Branch Target Identification (FEAT_BTI) in the
         hypervisor.
    
       - Use a separate set of pointer authentication keys for the
         hypervisor when running in protected mode, as the host is untrusted
         at runtime.
    
       - Ensure timer IRQs are consistently released in the init failure
         paths.
    
       - Avoid trapping CTR_EL0 on systems with Enhanced Virtualization
         Traps (FEAT_EVT), as it is a register commonly read from userspace.
    
       - Erratum workaround for the upcoming AmpereOne part, which has
         broken hardware A/D state management.
    
      RISC-V:
    
       - Redirect AMO load/store misaligned traps to KVM guest
    
       - Trap-n-emulate AIA in-kernel irqchip for KVM guest
    
       - Svnapot support for KVM Guest
    
      s390:
    
       - New uvdevice secret API
    
       - CMM selftest and fixes
    
       - fix racy access to target CPU for diag 9c
    
      x86:
    
       - Fix missing/incorrect #GP checks on ENCLS
    
       - Use standard mmu_notifier hooks for handling APIC access page
    
       - Drop now unnecessary TR/TSS load after VM-Exit on AMD
    
       - Print more descriptive information about the status of SEV and
         SEV-ES during module load
    
       - Add a test for splitting and reconstituting hugepages during and
         after dirty logging
    
       - Add support for CPU pinning in demand paging test
    
       - Add support for AMD PerfMonV2, with a variety of cleanups and minor
         fixes included along the way
    
       - Add a "nx_huge_pages=never" option to effectively avoid creating NX
         hugepage recovery threads (because nx_huge_pages=off can be toggled
         at runtime)
    
       - Move handling of PAT out of MTRR code and dedup SVM+VMX code
    
       - Fix output of PIC poll command emulation when there's an interrupt
    
       - Add a maintainer's handbook to document KVM x86 processes,
         preferred coding style, testing expectations, etc.
    
       - Misc cleanups, fixes and comments
    
      Generic:
    
       - Miscellaneous bugfixes and cleanups
    
      Selftests:
    
       - Generate dependency files so that partial rebuilds work as
         expected"
