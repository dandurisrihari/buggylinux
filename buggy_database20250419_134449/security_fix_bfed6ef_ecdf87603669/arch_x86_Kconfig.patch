    Merge tag 'x86_sgx_for_v5.17_rc1' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tip/tip
    
    Pull x86 SGX updates from Borislav Petkov:
    
     - Add support for handling hw errors in SGX pages: poisoning,
       recovering from poison memory and error injection into SGX pages
    
     - A bunch of changes to the SGX selftests to simplify and allow of SGX
       features testing without the need of a whole SGX software stack
    
     - Add a sysfs attribute which is supposed to show the amount of SGX
       memory in a NUMA node, similar to what /proc/meminfo is to normal
       memory
    
     - The usual bunch of fixes and cleanups too
