  "body": "Drivers/devices without their own rate control algorithm can get the\ninformation what rates they should use from either the radiotap header of\ninjected frames or from the rate control algorithm. But the parsing of the\nlegacy rate information from the radiotap header was removed in commit\ne6a9854b05c1 (\"mac80211/drivers: rewrite the rate control API\").\n\nThe removal of this feature heavily reduced the usefulness of frame\ninjection when wanting to simulate specific transmission behavior. Having\nrate parsing together with MCS rates and retry support allows a fine\ngrained selection of the tx behavior of injected frames for these kind of\ntests.\n\nSigned-off-by: Sven Eckelmann <sven@narfation.org>\nCc: Simon Wunderlich <sw@simonwunderlich.de>\nSigned-off-by: Johannes Berg <johannes.berg@intel.com>",
