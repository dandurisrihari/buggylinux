    arm64: Implement branch predictor hardening for Falkor
    
    Falkor is susceptible to branch predictor aliasing and can
    theoretically be attacked by malicious code. This patch
    implements a mitigation for these attacks, preventing any
    malicious entries from affecting other victim contexts.
