  "body": "By coincidence, the VVAR page is at the end of an ELF segment.  As a\nresult, if it ends up being a partial page, the kernel loader will\nleave garbage behind at the end of the vvar page.  Zero-pad it to a\nfull page to fix this issue.\n\nThis has probably been broken since the VVAR page was introduced.\nOn QEMU, if you dump the run-time contents of the VVAR page, you can\nfind entertaining strings from seabios left behind.\n\nIt's remotely possible that this is a security bug -- conceivably\nthere's some BIOS out there that leaves something sensitive in the\nfew K of memory that is exposed to userspace.\n\nSigned-off-by: Stefani Seibold <stefani@seibold.net>\nLink: http://lkml.kernel.org/r/1395094933-14252-12-git-send-email-stefani@seibold.net\nSigned-off-by: H.
