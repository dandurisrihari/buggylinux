Full commit message:
x86, vdso: Zero-pad the VVAR page

By coincidence, the VVAR page is at the end of an ELF segment.  As a
result, if it ends up being a partial page, the kernel loader will
leave garbage behind at the end of the vvar page.  Zero-pad it to a
full page to fix this issue.

This has probably been broken since the VVAR page was introduced.
On QEMU, if you dump the run-time contents of the VVAR page, you can
find entertaining strings from seabios left behind.

It's remotely possible that this is a security bug -- conceivably
there's some BIOS out there that leaves something sensitive in the
few K of memory that is exposed to userspace.
