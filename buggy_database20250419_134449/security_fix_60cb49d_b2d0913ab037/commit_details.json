In addition to BT_CONFIG,\nBT_CONNECTED is also a state in which we may get a remote name and need\nto indicate over mgmt the connection status. This scenario is\nparticularly likely to happen for incoming connections that do not need\nauthentication since there the hci_conn state will reach BT_CONNECTED\nbefore the remote name is received.\n\nSigned-off-by: Johan Hedberg <johan.hedberg@intel.com>\nSigned-off-by: Marcel Holtmann <marcel@holtmann.org>",
