Full commit message:
Merge tag 'media/v6.1-2' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mchehab/linux-media

Pull missed media updates from Mauro Carvalho Chehab:
 "It seems I screwed-up my previous pull request: it ends up that only
  half of the media patches that were in linux-next got merged in -rc1.

  The script which creates the signed tags silently failed due to
  5.19->6.0 so it ended generating a tag with incomplete stuff.

  So here are the missing parts:

   - a DVB core security fix

   - lots of fixes and cleanups for atomisp staging driver

   - old drivers that are VB1 are being moved to staging to be
     deprecated

   - several driver updates - mostly for embedded systems, but there are
     also some things addressing issues with some PC webcams, in the UVC
     video driver"
