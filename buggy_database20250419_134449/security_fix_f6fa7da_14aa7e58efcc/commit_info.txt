====================
tools: ynl: two patches to ease building with rpmbuild

I'm looking to build and package ynl for Fedora and Centos Stream users.
Default rpmbuild has couple hardening options enabled by default [1][2],
which currently prevent ynl from building.

This series contains 2 small patches to address it.
