    x86/bugs, kvm: Introduce boot-time control of L1TF mitigations
    
    Introduce the 'l1tf=' kernel command line option to allow for boot-time
    switching of mitigation that is used on processors affected by L1TF.
    
    The possible values are:
    
      full
            Provides all available mitigations for the L1TF vulnerability. Disables
            SMT and enables all mitigations in the hypervisors. SMT control via
            /sys/devices/system/cpu/smt/control is still possible after boot.
            Hypervisors will issue a warning when the first VM is started in
            a potentially insecure configuration, i.e. SMT enabled or L1D flush
            disabled.
    
      full,force
            Same as 'full', but disables SMT control. Implies the 'nosmt=force'
            command line option. sysfs control of SMT and the hypervisor flush
            control is disabled.
    
      flush
            Leaves SMT enabled and enables the conditional hypervisor mitigation.
            Hypervisors will issue a warning when the first VM is started in a
            potentially insecure configuration, i.e. SMT enabled or L1D flush
            disabled.
    
      flush,nosmt
            Disables SMT and enables the conditional hypervisor mitigation. SMT
            control via /sys/devices/system/cpu/smt/control is still possible
            after boot. If SMT is reenabled or flushing disabled at runtime
            hypervisors will issue a warning.
    
      flush,nowarn
            Same as 'flush', but hypervisors will not warn when
            a VM is started in a potentially insecure configuration.
    
      off
            Disables hypervisor mitigations and doesn't emit any warnings.
    
    Default is 'flush'.
    
    Let KVM adhere to these semantics, which means:
    
      - 'lt1f=full,force'   : Performe L1D flushes. No runtime control
                              possible.
    
      - 'l1tf=full'
      - 'l1tf-flush'
      - 'l1tf=flush,nosmt'  : Perform L1D flushes and warn on VM start if
                              SMT has been runtime enabled or L1D flushing
                              has been run-time enabled
    
      - 'l1tf=flush,nowarn' : Perform L1D flushes and no warnings are emitted.
    
      - 'l1tf=off'          : L1D flushes are not performed and no warnings
                              are emitted.
    
    KVM can always override the L1D flushing behavior using its 'vmentry_l1d_flush'
    module parameter except when lt1f=full,force is set.
    
    This makes KVM's private 'nosmt' option redundant, and as it is a bit
    non-systematic anyway (this is something to control globally, not on
    hypervisor level), remove that option.
    
    Add the missing Documentation entry for the l1tf vulnerability sysfs file
    while at it.
