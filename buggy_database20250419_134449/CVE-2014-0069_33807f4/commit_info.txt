Full commit message:
Merge branch 'for-next' of git://git.samba.org/sfrench/cifs-2.6

Pull CIFS fixes from Steve French:
 "A fix for the problem which Al spotted in cifs_writev and a followup
  (noticed when fixing CVE-2014-0069) patch to ensure that cifs never
  sends more than the smb frame length over the socket (as we saw with
  that cifs_iovec_write problem that Jeff fixed last month)"

* 'for-next' of git://git.samba.org/sfrench/cifs-2.6:
  cifs: mask off top byte in get_rfc1002_length()
  cifs: sanity check length of data to send before sending
  CIFS: Fix wrong pos argument of cifs_find_lock_conflict
