    Pull kvm updates from Paolo Bonzini:
     "S390:
    
       - ultravisor communication device driver
    
       - fix TEID on terminating storage key ops
    
      RISC-V:
    
       - Added Sv57x4 support for G-stage page table
    
       - Added range based local HFENCE functions
    
       - Added remote HFENCE functions based on VCPU requests
    
       - Added ISA extension registers in ONE_REG interface
    
       - Updated KVM RISC-V maintainers entry to cover selftests support
    
      ARM:
    
       - Add support for the ARMv8.6 WFxT extension
    
       - Guard pages for the EL2 stacks
    
       - Trap and emulate AArch32 ID registers to hide unsupported features
    
       - Ability to select and save/restore the set of hypercalls exposed to
         the guest
    
       - Support for PSCI-initiated suspend in collaboration with userspace
    
       - GICv3 register-based LPI invalidation support
    
       - Move host PMU event merging into the vcpu data structure
    
       - GICv3 ITS save/restore fixes
    
       - The usual set of small-scale cleanups and fixes
    
      x86:
    
       - New ioctls to get/set TSC frequency for a whole VM
    
       - Allow userspace to opt out of hypercall patching
    
       - Only do MSR filtering for MSRs accessed by rdmsr/wrmsr
    
      AMD SEV improvements:
    
       - Add KVM_EXIT_SHUTDOWN metadata for SEV-ES
    
       - V_TSC_AUX support
    
      Nested virtualization improvements for AMD:
    
       - Support for "nested nested" optimizations (nested vVMLOAD/VMSAVE,
         nested vGIF)
    
       - Allow AVIC to co-exist with a nested guest running
    
       - Fixes for LBR virtualizations when a nested guest is running, and
         nested LBR virtualization support
    
       - PAUSE filtering for nested hypervisors
    
      Guest support:
    
       - Decoupling of vcpu_is_preempted from PV spinlocks"
