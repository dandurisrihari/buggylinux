Full commit message:
e1000e: enhance frame fragment detection

Originally patched by Neil Horman <nhorman@tuxdriver.com>

e1000e could with a jumbo frame enabled interface, and packet split disabled,
receive a packet that would overflow a single rx buffer.  While in practice
very hard to craft a packet that could abuse this, it is possible.

this is related to CVE-2009-4538
