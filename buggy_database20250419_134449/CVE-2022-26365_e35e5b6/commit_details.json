Additionally the granularity of the grant table\n   doesn't allow sharing less than a 4K page, leading to unrelated data\n   residing in the same 4K page as data shared with a backend being\n   accessible by such backend (CVE-2022-33741, CVE-2022-33742).\n\n - XSA-405 (1 patch for netfront driver, only 5.10 and newer):\n\n   While adding logic to support XDP (eXpress Data Path), a code label\n   was moved in a way allowing for SKBs having references (pointers)\n   retained for further processing to nevertheless be freed.\n\n - XSA-406 (1 patch for Arm specific dom0 code):\n\n   When mapping pages of guests on Arm, dom0 is using an rbtree to keep\n   track of the foreign mappings.\n\n   Updating of that rbtree is not always done completely with the\n   related lock held, resulting in a small race window, which can be\n   used by unprivileged guests via PV devices to cause inconsistencies\n   of the rbtree.
