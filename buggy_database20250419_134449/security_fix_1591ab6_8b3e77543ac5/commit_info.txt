John W. Linville says:

====================
This is a batch of fixes intende for the 3.8 stream.

Regarding the iwlwifi bits, Johannes says this:

"Please pull to get a single fix from Emmanuel for a bug I introduced due
to misunderstanding the code."

Regarding the mac80211 bits, Johannes says this:

"I have a few small fixes for you:
 * some mesh frames would cause encryption warnings -- fixes from Bob
 * scanning would pretty much break an association if we transmitted
   anything to the AP while scanning -- fix from Stanislaw
 * mode injection was broken by channel contexts -- fix from Felix
 * FT roaming was broken: hardware crypto would get disabled by it"

Along with that, a handful of other fixes confined to specific drivers.

Avinash Patil fixes a typo in a NULL check in mwifiex.

Larry Finger fixes a build warning in rtlwifi.  Seems safe...

Stanislaw Gruszka fixes iwlegacy to prevent microcode errors when
switching from IBSS mode to STA mode.

Felix Fietkau provides a trio of ath9k fixes related to proper tuning.

Please let me know if there are problems!
