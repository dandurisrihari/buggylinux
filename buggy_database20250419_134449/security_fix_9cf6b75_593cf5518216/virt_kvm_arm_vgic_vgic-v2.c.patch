    Pull arm64 fixes from Will Deacon:
     "Hot on the heels of our last set of fixes are a few more for -rc7.
    
      Two of them are fixing issues with our virtual interrupt controller
      implementation in KVM/arm, while the other is a longstanding but
      straightforward kallsyms fix which was been acked by Masami and
      resolves an initialisation failure in kprobes observed on arm64.
    
       - Fix GICv2 emulation bug (KVM)
    
       - Fix deadlock in virtual GIC interrupt injection code (KVM)
    
       - Fix kprobes blacklist init failure due to broken kallsyms lookup"
