  "body": "This driver is known to work on mine and Tony's test environments,\nusing software error injection, and a partial hardware/software\nerror injection tool.\n\nThere's no broader range test yet to double check if the error decoding\nlogic will actually point to the right DIMM, so use it with care.\nMore tests are required to be sure that the driver will work on all\ndifferent types of memory configurations.\n\nIf you're willing to risk using it, I suggest you to enable EDAC debugs\nfor your test machines, as the debug logs helps to track what's going\ninside the driver.\n\nPlease feed me with bug reports, if you notice that the driver\nis miss-behaving.\n\nTested-by: Tony Luck <tony.luck@intel.com>\nSigned-off-by: Mauro Carvalho Chehab <mchehab@redhat.com>",
