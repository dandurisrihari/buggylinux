Full commit message:
ALSA: emu10k1: validate min/max values of translated controls

User space could pass arbitrary ranges, which were uncritically
accepted. This could lead to table lookups out of range.

I don't think that this is a security issue, as it only allowed someone
with CAP_SYS_ADMIN to crash the kernel, but still.

Setting an invalid translation mode will also be rejected now. That did
no harm, but it's still better to detect errors.
