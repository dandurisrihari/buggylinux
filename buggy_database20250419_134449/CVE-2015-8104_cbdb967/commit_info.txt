Subject: KVM: svm: unconditionally intercept #DB

CVE Identifiers:
- CVE-2015-8104

Full commit message:
KVM: svm: unconditionally intercept #DB

This is needed to avoid the possibility that the guest triggers
an infinite stream of #DB exceptions (CVE-2015-8104).

VMX is not affected: because it does not save DR6 in the VMCS,
it already intercepts #DB unconditionally.
