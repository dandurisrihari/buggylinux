Full commit message:
KVM: arm64: Force SRE traps when SRE access is not enabled

We so far only write the ICH_HCR_EL2 config in two situations:

- when we need to emulate the GICv3 CPU interface due to HW bugs

- when we do direct injection, as the virtual CPU interface needs
  to be enabled

This is all good. But it also means that we don't do anything special
when we emulate a GICv2, or that there is no GIC at all.

What happens in this case when the guest uses the GICv3 system
registers? The *guest* gets a trap for a sysreg access (EC=0x18)
while we'd really like it to get an UNDEF.

Fixing this is a bit involved:

- we need to set all the required trap bits (TC, TALL0, TALL1, TDIR)

- for these traps to take effect, we need to (counter-intuitively)
  set ICC_SRE_EL1.SRE to 1 so that the above traps take priority.

Note that doesn't fully work when GICv2 emulation is enabled, as
we cannot set ICC_SRE_EL1.SRE to 1 (it breaks Group0 delivery as
IRQ).
