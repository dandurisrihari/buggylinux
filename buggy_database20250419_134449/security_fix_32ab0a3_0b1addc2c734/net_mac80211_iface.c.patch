    ====================
    Among various cleanups and improvements, we have the following:
     * client FILS authentication support in mac80211 (Jouni)
     * AP/VLAN multicast improvements (Michael Braun)
     * config/advertising support for differing beacon intervals on
       multiple virtual interfaces (Purushottam Kushwaha, myself)
     * deprecate the old WDS mode for cfg80211-based drivers, the
       mode is hardly usable since it doesn't support any "modern"
       features like WPA encryption (2003), HT (2009) or VHT (2014),
       I'm not even sure WEP (introduced in 1997) could be done.
