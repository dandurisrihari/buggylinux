  "body": "When a new hci_conn object is created the remote SSP authentication\nrequirement is set to the invalid value 0xff to indicate that it is\nunknown. Once pairing completes however the code was leaving it as-is.\nIn case a new pairing happens over the same connection it is important\nthat we reset the value back to unknown so that the pairing code doesn't\nmake false assumptions about the requirements.\n\nSigned-off-by: Johan Hedberg <johan.hedberg@intel.com>\nSigned-off-by: Marcel Holtmann <marcel@holtmann.org>",
