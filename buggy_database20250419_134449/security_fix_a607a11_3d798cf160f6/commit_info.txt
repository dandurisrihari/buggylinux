Full commit message:
Merge git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/nab/target-pending

Pull SCSI target fixes from Nicholas Bellinger:
 "These are mostly minor fixes this time around.  The iscsi-target CHAP
  big-endian bugfix and bump FD_MAX_SECTORS=2048 default patch to allow
  1MB sized I/Os for FILEIO backends on >= v3.5 code are both CC'ed to
  stable.

  Also, there is a persistent reservations regression that has recently
  been reported for >= v3.8.x code, that is currently being tracked down
  for v3.9."
