Full commit message:
svm: Temporarily deactivate AVIC during ExtINT handling

AMD AVIC does not support ExtINT. Therefore, AVIC must be temporary
deactivated and fall back to using legacy interrupt injection via vINTR
and interrupt window.

Also, introduce APICV_INHIBIT_REASON_IRQWIN to be used for this reason.
