Subject: xen-pciback: limit guest control of command register

CVE Identifiers:
- CVE-2015-2150

Full commit message:
xen-pciback: limit guest control of command register

Otherwise the guest can abuse that control to cause e.g. PCIe
Unsupported Request responses by disabling memory and/or I/O decoding
and subsequently causing (CPU side) accesses to the respective address
ranges, which (depending on system configuration) may be fatal to the
host.

Note that to alter any of the bits collected together as
PCI_COMMAND_GUEST permissive mode is now required to be enabled
globally or on the specific device.

This is CVE-2015-2150 / XSA-120.
