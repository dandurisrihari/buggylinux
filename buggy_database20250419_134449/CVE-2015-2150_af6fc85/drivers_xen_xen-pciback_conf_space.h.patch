    xen-pciback: limit guest control of command register
    
    Otherwise the guest can abuse that control to cause e.g. PCIe
    Unsupported Request responses by disabling memory and/or I/O decoding
    and subsequently causing (CPU side) accesses to the respective address
    ranges, which (depending on system configuration) may be fatal to the
    host.
    
    Note that to alter any of the bits collected together as
    PCI_COMMAND_GUEST permissive mode is now required to be enabled
    globally or on the specific device.
    
    This is CVE-2015-2150 / XSA-120.
