  "subject": "arm64: add ptrace regsets for ptrauth key management",
  "body": "Add two new ptrace regsets, which can be used to request and change the\npointer authentication keys of a thread. NT_ARM_PACA_KEYS gives access\nto the instruction/data address keys, and NT_ARM_PACG_KEYS to the\ngeneric authentication key. The keys are also part of the core dump file\nof the process.\n\nThe regsets are only exposed if the kernel is compiled with\nCONFIG_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE=y, as the only intended use case is\ncheckpointing and restoring processes that are using pointer\nauthentication. (This can be changed later if there are other use\ncases.)\n\nReviewed-by: Dave Martin <Dave.Martin@arm.com>\nSigned-off-by: Kristina Martsenko <kristina.martsenko@arm.com>\nSigned-off-by: Catalin Marinas <catalin.marinas@arm.com>",
