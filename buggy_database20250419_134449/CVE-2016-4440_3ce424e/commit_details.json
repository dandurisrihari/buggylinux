  "body": "The function to update APICv on/off state (in particular, to deactivate\nit when enabling Hyper-V SynIC) is incomplete: it doesn't adjust\nAPICv-related fields among secondary processor-based VM-execution\ncontrols.  As a result, Windows 2012 guests get stuck when SynIC-based\nauto-EOI interrupt intersected with e.g. an IPI in the guest.\n\nIn addition, the MSR intercept bitmap isn't updated every time \"virtualize\nx2APIC mode\" is toggled.  This path can only be triggered by a malicious\nguest, because Windows didn't use x2APIC but rather their own synthetic\nAPIC access MSRs; however a guest running in a SynIC-enabled VM could\nswitch to x2APIC and thus obtain direct access to host APIC MSRs\n(CVE-2016-4440).\n\nThe patch fixes those omissions.\n\nSigned-off-by: Roman Kagan <rkagan@virtuozzo.com>\nReported-by: Steve Rutherford <srutherford@google.com>\nReported-by: Yang Zhang <yang.zhang.wz@gmail.com>\nSigned-off-by: Paolo Bonzini <pbonzini@redhat.com>",
