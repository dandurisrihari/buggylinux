    f2fs: rework fault injection handling to avoid a warning
    
    When CONFIG_F2FS_FAULT_INJECTION is disabled, we get a warning about an
    unused label:
    
    fs/f2fs/segment.c: In function '__submit_discard_cmd':
    fs/f2fs/segment.c:1059:1: error: label 'submit' defined but not used [-Werror=unused-label]
    
    This could be fixed by adding another #ifdef around it, but the more
    reliable way of doing this seems to be to remove the other #ifdefs
    where that is easily possible.
    
    By defining time_to_inject() as a trivial stub, most of the checks for
    CONFIG_F2FS_FAULT_INJECTION can go away. This also leads to nicer
    formatting of the code.
