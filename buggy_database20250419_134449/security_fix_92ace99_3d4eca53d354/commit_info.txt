Full commit message:
add infrastructure for tagging functions as error injectable

Using BPF we can override kprob'ed functions and return arbitrary
values.  Obviously this can be a bit unsafe, so make this feature opt-in
for functions.  Simply tag a function with KPROBE_ERROR_INJECT_SYMBOL in
order to give BPF access to that function for error injection purposes.
