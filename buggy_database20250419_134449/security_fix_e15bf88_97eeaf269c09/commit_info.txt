Full commit message:
Merge tag 'perf-urgent-for-mingo' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/acme/linux into perf/urgent

Pull perf/urgent fixes from Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo:

  - Do not change the key of an object in a rbtree, this time it was
    the one for DSOs lookup by its long_name, and the noticed symptom was
    with 'perf buildid-list --with-hits' (Adrian Hunter)

  - 'perf inject' is a pipe, events it doesn't touch should be passed
    on, PERF_RECORD_LOST wasn't, fix it (Adrian Hunter)

  - Make 'perf buildid-list' request event ordering, as it needs to
    first get the mmap events to be able to mark wich DSOs had hits
    (Adrian Hunter)

  - Fix memory leaks on failure in 'perf probe' (Masami Hiramatsu, Wang Nan)
