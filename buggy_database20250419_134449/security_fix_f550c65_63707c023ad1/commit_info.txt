Full commit message:
scsi: ufs: implement scsi host timeout handler

A race condition exists between request requeueing and scsi layer
error handling:
When UFS driver queuecommand returns a busy status for a request,
it will be requeued and its tag will be freed and set to -1.
At the same time it is possible that the request will timeout and
scsi layer will start error handling for it. The scsi layer reuses
the request and its tag to send error related commands to the device,
however its tag is no longer valid.
As this request was never really sent to the device, there is no
point to start error handling with the device.
Implement the scsi error handling timeout callback and bypass SCSI
error handling for request that were not actually sent to the device.
For such requests simply reset the block layer timer. Otherwise, let
SCSI layer perform the usual error handling.
