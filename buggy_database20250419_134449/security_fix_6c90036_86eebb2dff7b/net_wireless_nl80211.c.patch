    nl80211: Allow set/del pmksa operations for AP
    
    Host drivers may offload authentication to the user space
    through the commit ("cfg80211: Authentication offload to
    user space in AP mode").
    
    This interface can be used to implement SAE by having the
    userspace do authentication/PMKID key derivation and driver
    handle the association.
    
    A step ahead, this interface can get further optimized if the
    PMKID is passed to the host driver and also have it respond to
    the association request by the STA on a valid PMKID.
    
    This commit enables the userspace to pass the PMKID to the host
    drivers through the set/del pmksa operations in AP mode.
    
    Set/Del pmksa is now restricted to STA/P2P client mode only and
    thus the drivers might not expect them in any other(AP) mode.
    
    This commit also introduces a feature flag
    NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_AP_PMKSA_CACHING (johannes: renamed) to
    maintain the backward compatibility of such an expectation by
    the host drivers. These operations are allowed in AP mode only
    when the drivers advertize the capability through this flag.
