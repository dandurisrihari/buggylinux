PAS (Peripheral Authentication Service)\n\nThey still describe the same hardware - firmware load for remote\nprocessor - but use different methods to communicate with that\nprocessor.\n\nFor these SoCs, the qcom,adsp.yaml bindings were describing the PAS\nmethod, however for easier customization of board DTS, the bindings\ncombined additional properties from PIL: reset lines, qcom,halt-regs and\nadditional clocks.  The devices and Linux kernel drivers, when\ninstantiated as PAS, do not use these properties, so drop them from the\nbindings.\n\nSigned-off-by: Krzysztof Kozlowski <krzysztof.kozlowski@linaro.org>\nAcked-by: Rob Herring <robh@kernel.org>\nSigned-off-by: Bjorn Andersson <andersson@kernel.org>\nLink: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20221124184333.133911-6-krzysztof.kozlowski@linaro.org",
