Full commit message:
dt-bindings: remoteproc: qcom,adsp: drop resets and qcom,halt-regs

Some remote processors (e.g. QCS404 CDSP, SC7180 MPSS/MSS) can be brought
to life using two different bindings:
1. PIL (Peripheral Image Loader)
2. PAS (Peripheral Authentication Service)

They still describe the same hardware - firmware load for remote
processor - but use different methods to communicate with that
processor.

For these SoCs, the qcom,adsp.yaml bindings were describing the PAS
method, however for easier customization of board DTS, the bindings
combined additional properties from PIL: reset lines, qcom,halt-regs and
additional clocks.  The devices and Linux kernel drivers, when
instantiated as PAS, do not use these properties, so drop them from the
bindings.
