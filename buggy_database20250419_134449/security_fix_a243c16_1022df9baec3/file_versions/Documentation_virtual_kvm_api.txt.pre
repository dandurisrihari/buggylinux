    KVM: arm64: Add userspace flag to enable pointer authentication
    
    Now that the building blocks of pointer authentication are present, lets
    add userspace flags KVM_ARM_VCPU_PTRAUTH_ADDRESS and
    KVM_ARM_VCPU_PTRAUTH_GENERIC. These flags will enable pointer
    authentication for the KVM guest on a per-vcpu basis through the ioctl
    KVM_ARM_VCPU_INIT.
    
    This features will allow the KVM guest to allow the handling of
    pointer authentication instructions or to treat them as undefined
    if not set.
    
    Necessary documentations are added to reflect the changes done.
