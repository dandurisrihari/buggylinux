====================
cn10k-ipsec: Add outbound inline ipsec support

This patch series adds outbound inline ipsec support on Marvell
cn10k series of platform. One crypto hardware logical function
(cpt-lf) per netdev is required for inline ipsec outbound
functionality. Software prepare and submit crypto hardware
(CPT) instruction for outbound inline ipsec crypto mode offload.
The CPT instruction have details for encryption and authentication
Crypto hardware encrypt, authenticate and provide the ESP packet
to network hardware logic to transmit ipsec packet.

First patch makes dma memory writable for in-place encryption,
Second patch moves code to common file, Third patch disable
backpressure on crypto (CPT) and network (NIX) hardware.
Patch four onwards enables inline outbound ipsec.

v9->v10:
 - Removed unlikely() in data-patch and used static_branch when at least
   a SA is configured.
 - Added missing READ_ONCE() as per comment on previous patch
 - Removed "\n" from end of extack messages
 - Poll for context write status check reduced to 100ms from 10s

v8->v9:
 - Removed mutex lock to use hardware, now using hardware state
 - Previous versions were supporting only 64 SAs and a bitmap was
   used for same. That limitation is removed from this version.
 - Replaced netdev_err with NL_SET_ERR_MSG_MOD in state add flow
   as per comment in previous version

v7->v8:
 - spell correction in patch 1/8 (s/sdk/skb)

v6->v7:
 - skb data was mapped as device writeable but it was not ensured
   that skb is writeable. This version calls skb_unshare() to make
   skb data writeable (Thanks Jakub Kicinski for pointing out).

v4->v5:
 - Fixed un-initialized warning and pointer check
   (comment from Kalesh Anakkur Purayil)

v3->v4:
 - Few error messages in data-path removed and some moved
   under netif_msg_tx_err().
 - Added check for crypto offload (XFRM_DEV_OFFLOAD_CRYPTO)
   Thanks "Leon Romanovsky" for pointing out
 - Fixed codespell error as per comment from Simon Horman
 - Added some other cleanup comment from Kalesh Anakkur Purayil

v2->v3:
 - Fix smatch and sparse errors (Comment from Simon Horman)
 - Fix build error with W=1 (Comment from Simon Horman)
   https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/netdevbpf/patch/20240513105446.297451-6-bbhushan2@marvell.com/
 - Some other minor cleanup as per comment
   https://www.spinics.net/lists/netdev/msg997197.html

v1->v2:
 - Fix compilation error to build driver a module
 - Use dma_wmb() instead of architecture specific barrier
 - Fix couple of other compilation warnings
