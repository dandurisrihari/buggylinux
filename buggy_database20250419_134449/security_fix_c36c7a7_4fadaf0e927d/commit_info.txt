Merge tag 'usb-4.15-rc4' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/usb

Pull USB fixes from Greg KH:
 "Here are some USB fixes for 4.15-rc4.

  There is the usual handful gadget/dwc2/dwc3 fixes as always, for
  reported issues. But the most important things in here is the core fix
  from Alan Stern to resolve a nasty security bug (my first attempt is
  reverted, Alan's was much cleaner), as well as a number of usbip fixes
  from Shuah Khan to resolve those reported security issues.

  All of these have been in linux-next with no reported issues"
