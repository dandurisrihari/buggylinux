Pull networking updates from David Miller:

 1) ax88796 does 64-bit divides which causes link errors on ARM, fix
    from Arnd Bergmann.

 2) Once an improper offload setting is detected on an SKB we don't rate
    limit the log message so we can very easily live lock.  From Ben
    Greear.

 3) Openvswitch cannot report vport configuration changes reliably
    because it didn't preallocate the netlink notification message
    before changing state.  From Jesse Gross.

 4) The effective UID/GID SCM credentials fix, from Linus.

 5) When a user explicitly asks for wireless authentication, cfg80211
    isn't told about the AP detachment leaving inconsistent state.  Fix
    from Johannes Berg.

 6) Fix self-MAC checks in batman-adv on multi-mesh nodes, from Antonio
    Quartulli.

 7) Revert build_skb() change sin IGB driver, can result in memory
    corruption.  From Alexander Duyck.

 8) Fix setting VLANs on virtual functions in IXGBE, from Greg Rose.

 9) Fix TSO races in qlcnic driver, from Sritej Velaga.

10) In bnx2x the kernel driver and UNDI firmware can try to program the
    chip at the same time, resulting in corruption.  Add proper
    synchronization.  From Dmitry Kravkov.

11) Fix corruption of status block in firmware ram in bxn2x, from Ariel
    Elior.

12) Fix load balancing hash regression of bonding driver in forwarding
    configurations, from Eric Dumazet.

13) Fix TS ECR regression in TCP by calling tcp_replace_ts_recent() in
    all the right spots, from Eric Dumazet.

14) Fix several bonding bugs having to do with address manintainence,
    including not removing address when configuration operations
    encounter errors, missed locking on the address lists, missing
    refcounting on VLAN objects, etc.  All from Nikolay Aleksandrov.

15) Add workarounds for firmware bugs in LTE qmi_wwan devices, wherein
    the devices fail to add a proper ethernet header while on LTE
    networks but otherwise properly do so on 2G and 3G ones.  From Bj√∏rn
    Mork.
