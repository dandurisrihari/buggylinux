Full commit message:
netfilter: fix nf_queue handling

nf_queue handling is broken since e3b37f11e6e4 ("netfilter: replace
list_head with single linked list") for two reasons:

1) If the bypass flag is set on, there are no userspace listeners and
   we still have more hook entries to iterate over, then jump to the
   next hook. Otherwise accept the packet. On nf_reinject() path, the
   okfn() needs to be invoked.

2) We should not re-enter the same hook on packet reinjection. If the
   packet is accepted, we have to skip the current hook from where the
   packet was enqueued, otherwise the packets gets enqueued over and
   over again.

This restores the previous list_for_each_entry_continue() behaviour
happening from nf_iterate() that was dealing with these two cases.
This patch introduces a new nf_queue() wrapper function so this fix
becomes simpler.
