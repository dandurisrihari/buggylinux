    Bluetooth: Reject connection with the device which has same BD_ADDR
    
    This change is used to relieve CVE-2020-26555. The description of
    the CVE:
    
    Bluetooth legacy BR/EDR PIN code pairing in Bluetooth Core Specification
    1.0B through 5.2 may permit an unauthenticated nearby device to spoof
    the BD_ADDR of the peer device to complete pairing without knowledge
    of the PIN. [1]
    
    The detail of this attack is in IEEE paper:
    BlueMirror: Reflections on Bluetooth Pairing and Provisioning Protocols
    [2]
    
    It's a reflection attack. The paper mentioned that attacker can induce
    the attacked target to generate null link key (zero key) without PIN
    code. In BR/EDR, the key generation is actually handled in the controller
    which is below HCI.
    
    A condition of this attack is that attacker should change the
    BR_ADDR of his hacking device (Host B) to equal to the BR_ADDR with
    the target device being attacked (Host A).
    
    Thus, we reject the connection with device which has same BD_ADDR
    both on HCI_Create_Connection and HCI_Connection_Request to prevent
    the attack. A similar implementation also shows in btstack project.
