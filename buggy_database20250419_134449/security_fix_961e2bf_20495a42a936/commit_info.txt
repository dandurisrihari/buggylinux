Full commit message:
Merge tag 'kvmarm-6.9' of https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/kvmarm/kvmarm into HEAD

KVM/arm64 updates for 6.9

 - Infrastructure for building KVM's trap configuration based on the
   architectural features (or lack thereof) advertised in the VM's ID
   registers

 - Support for mapping vfio-pci BARs as Normal-NC (vaguely similar to
   x86's WC) at stage-2, improving the performance of interacting with
   assigned devices that can tolerate it

 - Conversion of KVM's representation of LPIs to an xarray, utilized to
   address serialization some of the serialization on the LPI injection
   path

 - Support for _architectural_ VHE-only systems, advertised through the
   absence of FEAT_E2H0 in the CPU's ID register

 - Miscellaneous cleanups, fixes, and spelling corrections to KVM and
   selftests
