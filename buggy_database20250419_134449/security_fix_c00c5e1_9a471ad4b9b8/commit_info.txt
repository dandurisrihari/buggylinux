Full commit message:
Merge tag 'ext4_for_linus_stable' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tytso/ext4

Pull ext4 fixes from Ted Ts'o:
 "Fix some syzbot-detected bugs, as well as other bugs found by I/O
  injection testing.

  Change ext4's fallocate to consistently drop set[ug]id bits when an
  fallocate operation might possibly change the user-visible contents of
  a file.

  Also, improve handling of potentially invalid values in the the
  s_overhead_cluster superblock field to avoid ext4 returning a negative
  number of free blocks"
