Instead, we try to use AUTH_SYS, and fail if\nthe server does not support it.  This prevents us from negotiating\nan inappropriate security flavor (some servers list AUTH_NULL first).\n\nIf the server does not support AUTH_SYS, the user must provide an\nappropriate security flavor by specifying the \"sec=\" mount option.\n\nSigned-off-by: Chuck Lever <chuck.lever@oracle.com>\nSigned-off-by: Trond Myklebust <Trond.Myklebust@netapp.com>",
