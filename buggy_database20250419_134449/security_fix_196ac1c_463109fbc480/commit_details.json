  "body": "The IDLE handling in HW off-channel is broken right\nnow since we turn off IDLE only when the off-channel\nperiod already started. Therefore, all drivers that\nuse it today (only iwlwifi!) must support off-channel\nwhile idle, so playing with idle isn't needed at all.\n\nOff-channel in general, since it's no longer used for\nauthentication/association, shouldn't affect PS, so\nalso remove that logic.\n\nAlso document a small caveat for reporting TX status\nfrom off-channel frames in HW remain-on-channel.\n\nSigned-off-by: Johannes Berg <johannes.berg@intel.com>\nSigned-off-by: John W.
