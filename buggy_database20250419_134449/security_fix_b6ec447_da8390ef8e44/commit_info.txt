John W. Linville says:

====================
Please consider this pull request for the 3.8 stream...

Included is a bluetooth pull.  Gustavo says:

"Two simple fixes for 3.8. One of the patches fixes a situation
where the connection wasn't terminated if a timeout ocurrs for LE
an SCO connections.  The other fixes prevent NULL dereference in the
SMP code, it is a security fix as well."

Along with those...

Hauke Mehrtens provides a couple of ssb and bcma bus fixes that
prevent oopses when unloading those modules.

Larry Finger provides and rtlwifi fix to avoid a "scheduling while
atomic" bug.

Last but certainly not least, Arend van Spriel bring a brcmsmac fix that
reworks the mac80211 .flush() callback in order to avoid the dreaded
brcms_c_wait_for_tx_completion warnings.  This one looks a little
large, but I think it is safe and isolated to brcmsmac in any case.
