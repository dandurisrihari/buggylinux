The other fixes prevent NULL dereference in the\nSMP code, it is a security fix as well.\"\n\nAlong with those...\n\nHauke Mehrtens provides a couple of ssb and bcma bus fixes that\nprevent oopses when unloading those modules.\n\nLarry Finger provides and rtlwifi fix to avoid a \"scheduling while\natomic\" bug.\n\nLast but certainly not least, Arend van Spriel bring a brcmsmac fix that\nreworks the mac80211 .flush() callback in order to avoid the dreaded\nbrcms_c_wait_for_tx_completion warnings.  This one looks a little\nlarge, but I think it is safe and isolated to brcmsmac in any case.\n====================\n\nSigned-off-by: David S. Miller <davem@davemloft.net>",
