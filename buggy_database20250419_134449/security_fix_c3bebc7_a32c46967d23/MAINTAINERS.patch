    Pull networking fixes from David Miller:
    
     1) Fix memory leak in ieee80211_prep_connection(), sta_info leaked on
        error.  From Eytan Lifshitz.
    
     2) Unintentional switch case fallthrough in nft_reject_inet_eval(),
        from Patrick McHardy.
    
     3) Must check if payload lenth is a power of 2 in
        nft_payload_select_ops(), from Nikolay Aleksandrov.
    
     4) Fix mis-checksumming in xen-netfront driver, ip_hdr() is not in the
        correct place when we invoke skb_checksum_setup().  From Wei Liu.
    
     5) TUN driver should not advertise HW vlan offload features in
        vlan_features.  Fix from Fernando Luis Vazquez Cao.
    
     6) IPV6_VTI needs to select NET_IPV_TUNNEL to avoid build errors, fix
        from Steffen Klassert.
    
     7) Add missing locking in xfrm_migrade_state_find(), we must hold the
        per-namespace xfrm_state_lock while traversing the lists.  Fix from
        Steffen Klassert.
    
     8) Missing locking in ath9k driver, access to tid->sched must be done
        under ath_txq_lock().  Fix from Stanislaw Gruszka.
    
     9) Fix two bugs in TCP fastopen.  First respect the size argument given
        to tcp_sendmsg() in the fastopen path, and secondly prevent
        tcp_send_syn_data() from potentially using order-5 allocations.
        From Eric Dumazet.
    
    10) Fix handling of default neigh garbage collection params, from Jiri
        Pirko.
    
    11) Fix cwnd bloat and over-inflation of RTT when transmit segmentation
        is in use.  From Eric Dumazet.
    
    12) Missing initialization of Realtek r8169 driver's statistics
        seqlocks.  Fix from Kyle McMartin.
    
    13) Fix RTNL assertion failures in 802.3ad and AB ARP monitor of bonding
        driver, from Ding Tianhong.
    
    14) Bonding slave release race can cause divide by zero, fix from
        Nikolay Aleksandrov.
    
    15) Overzealous return from neigh_periodic_work() causes reachability
        time to not be computed.  Fix from Duain Jiong.
    
    16) Fix regression in ipv6_find_hdr(), it should not return -ENOENT when
        a specific target is specified and found.  From Hans Schillstrom.
    
    17) Fix VLAN tag stripping regression in BNA driver, from Ivan Vecera.
    
    18) Tail loss probe can calculate bogus RTTs due to missing packet
        marking on retransmit.  Fix from Yuchung Cheng.
    
    19) We cannot do skb_dst_drop() in iptunnel_pull_header() because
        multicast loopback detection in later code paths need access to
        skb_rtable().  Fix from Xin Long.
    
    20) The macvlan driver regresses in that it propagates lower device
        offload support disables into itself, causing severe slowdowns when
        running over a bridge.  Provide the software offloads always on
        macvlan devices to deal with this and the regression is gone.  From
        Vlad Yasevich.
