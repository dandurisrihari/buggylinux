Pull networking fixes from David Miller:

 1) Fix timeouts with direct mode authentication in mac80211, from
    Stanislaw Gruszka.

 2) Aggregation sessions can deadlock in ath9k, from Felix Fietkau.

 3) Netfilter's xt_addrtype doesn't work with ipv6 due to route lookups
    creating undesirable cache entries, from Florian Westphal.

 4) Fix netfilter's ipt_ULOG from generating non-NULL terminated
    strings.

 5) Fix netdev transmit queue crashes in mac80211, from Johannes Berg.

 6) Fix copy and paste error in 802.11 stack that broke reporting of
    64-bit station tx statistics, from Felix Fietkau.

 7) When qlge_probe fails, it leaks the netdev.  Fix from Wei Yongjun.

 8) SKB control block (where we store the IP options information,
    amongst other things) must be cleared properly otherwise ICMP
    sending can crash for IP tunnels.  Fix from Eric Dumazet.

 9) Verification of Energy Efficient Ether support was coded wrongly,
    the test was inversed.  Fix from Giuseppe CAVALLARO.

10) TCP handles redirects improperly because the wrong flow key is used
    for the route lookup.  From Michal Kubecek.

11) Don't interpret MSG_CMSG_COMPAT from userspace, fix from Andy
    Lutomirski.

12) The new AF_VSOCK was missing from the lockdep string table, fix from
    Federico Vaga.

13) be2net doesn't handle checksumming of IP fragments properly, from
    Somnath Kotur.

14) Fix several bugs in the device address list code that lead to
    crashes and other misbehaviors.  From Jay Vosburgh.

15) Fix ipv6 segmentation handling of fragmented GRE tunnel traffic,
    from Pravin B Shalr.

16) Fix usage of stale policies in IPSEC layer, from Paul Moore.

17) Fix team driver dump of ports when there are a large number of them,
    from Jiri Pirko.

18) Fix softlockups in UDP ipv4 socket lookup causes by and error in the
    hlist_nulls_for_each_entry_rcu() macro.  From Eric Dumazet.

19) Fix several regressions added by the high rate accuracy changes to
    the htb packet scheduler.  From Eric Dumazet.

20) Fix DMA'ing onto the stack in esd_usb2 and peak_usb CAN drivers,
    from Olivier Sobrie and Marc Kleine-Budde.

21) Fix unremovable network devices due to missing route pointer
    installation in the per-device ipv6 address list entries.  From Gao
    feng.

22) Apply the tg3 5719 DMA workaround on 5720 chips as well, otherwise
    we get stalls.  From Nithin Sujir.
