Full commit message:
mac80211: configure default wmm params correctly

Default WMM params have to be set according to beacon/probe response
information prior to authentication (or IBSS start/join); beacon queue
is configured only in IBSS. This does not affect the use of 'real' WMM
params as reported by AP.
