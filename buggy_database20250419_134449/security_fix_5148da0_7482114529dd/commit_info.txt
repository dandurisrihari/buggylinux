Full commit message:
drm/xe: Allow fault injection in exec queue IOCTLs

Use fault injection infrastructure to allow specific functions to
be configured over debugfs for failing during the execution of
xe_exec_queue_create_ioctl(). xe_exec_queue_destroy_ioctl() and
xe_exec_queue_get_property_ioctl() are not considered as there is
no unwinding code to test with fault injection.

This allows more thorough testing from user space by going through
code paths for error handling and unwinding which cannot be reached
by simply injecting errors in IOCTL arguments. This can help
increase code robustness.
