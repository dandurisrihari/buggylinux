  "body": "One of the cases where the parameters for injection may be updated is\nwhen there are no more in-flight I/O requests. The number of in-flight\nrequests is stored in the field bfqd->rq_in_driver of the descriptor\nbfqd of the device. So, the controlled condition is\nbfqd->rq_in_driver == 0.\n\nUnfortunately, this is wrong because, the instruction that checks this\ncondition is in the code path that handles the completion of a\nrequest, and, in particular, the instruction is executed before\nbfqd->rq_in_driver is decremented in such a code path.\n\nThis commit fixes this issue by just replacing 0 with 1 in the\ncomparison.\n\nReported-by: Srivatsa S.
