Merge tag 'for-linus' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/virt/kvm/kvm

Pull KVM updates from Paolo Bonzini:
 "Small release overall.

  x86:
   - miscellaneous fixes
   - AVIC support (local APIC virtualization, AMD version)

  s390:
   - polling for interrupts after a VCPU goes to halted state is now
     enabled for s390
   - use hardware provided information about facility bits that do not
     need any hypervisor activity, and other fixes for cpu models and
     facilities
   - improve perf output
   - floating interrupt controller improvements.

  MIPS:
   - miscellaneous fixes

  PPC:
   - bugfixes only

  ARM:
   - 16K page size support
   - generic firmware probing layer for timer and GIC

  Christoffer Dall (KVM-ARM maintainer) says:
    "There are a few changes in this pull request touching things
     outside KVM, but they should all carry the necessary acks and it
     made the merge process much easier to do it this way."

  though actually the irqchip maintainers' acks didn't make it into the
  patches.  Marc Zyngier, who is both irqchip and KVM-ARM maintainer,
  later acked at http://mid.gmane.org/573351D1.4060303@arm.com ('more
  formally and for documentation purposes')"
