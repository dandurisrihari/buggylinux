  "body": "For all of you that think cciss should be a scsi driver here is the patch that\nyou have been waiting for all these years. This patch actually adds the SG_IO\nioctl to cciss. The primary purpose is for clustering and high-availibilty.\nBut now anyone can exploit this ioctl in any manner they wish.\n\nNote, SCSI_IOCTL_SEND_COMMAND doesn't work with this patch due to rq->errors\nbeing set incorrectly.  Subsequent patch fixes that.\n\nSigned-off-by: Stephen M.
