ALSA: asihpi: Hardening for potential Spectre v1

As recently Smatch suggested, a couple of places in ASIHPI driver may
expand the array directly from the user-space value with speculation:
  sound/pci/asihpi/hpimsginit.c:70 hpi_init_response() warn: potential spectre issue 'res_size' (local cap)
  sound/pci/asihpi/hpioctl.c:189 asihpi_hpi_ioctl() warn: potential spectre issue 'adapters'

This patch puts array_index_nospec() for hardening against them.
