Pull networking fixes from David Miller:
 "I'm sending a pull request of these lingering bug fixes for networking
  before the normal merge window material because some of this stuff I'd
  like to get to -stable ASAP"

 1) cxgb3 stopped working on 32-bit machines, fix from Ben Hutchings.

 2) Structures passed via netlink for netfilter logging are not fully
    initialized.  From Mathias Krause.

 3) Properly unlink upper openvswitch device during notifications, from
    Alexei Starovoitov.

 4) Fix race conditions involving access to the IP compression scratch
    buffer, from Michal Kubrecek.

 5) We don't handle the expiration of MTU information contained in ipv6
    routes sometimes, fix from Hannes Frederic Sowa.

 6) With Fast Open we can miscompute the TCP SYN/ACK RTT, from Yuchung
    Cheng.

 7) Don't take TCP RTT sample when an ACK doesn't acknowledge new data,
    also from Yuchung Cheng.

 8) The decreased IPSEC garbage collection threshold causes problems for
    some people, bump it back up.  From Steffen Klassert.

 9) Fix skb->truesize calculated by tcp_tso_segment(), from Eric
    Dumazet.

10) flow_dissector doesn't validate packet lengths sufficiently, from
    Jason Wang
