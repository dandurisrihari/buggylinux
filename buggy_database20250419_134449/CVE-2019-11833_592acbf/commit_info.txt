Subject: ext4: zero out the unused memory region in the extent tree block

CVE Identifiers:
- CVE-2019-11833

Full commit message:
ext4: zero out the unused memory region in the extent tree block

This commit zeroes out the unused memory region in the buffer_head
corresponding to the extent metablock after writing the extent header
and the corresponding extent node entries.

This is done to prevent random uninitialized data from getting into
the filesystem when the extent block is synced.

This fixes CVE-2019-11833.
