Full commit message:
KVM: arm/arm64: Remove kvm_vgic_inject_mapped_irq

The only benefit of having kvm_vgic_inject_mapped_irq separate from
kvm_vgic_inject_irq is that we pass a boolean that we use for error
checking on the injection path.

While this could potentially help in some aspect of robustness, it's
also a little bit of a defensive move, and arguably callers into the
vgic should have make sure they have marked their virtual IRQs as mapped
if required.
