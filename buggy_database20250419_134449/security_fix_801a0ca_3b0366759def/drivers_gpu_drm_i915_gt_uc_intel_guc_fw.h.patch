    drm/i915/huc: make "support huc" reflect HW capabilities
    
    We currently initialize HuC support based on GuC being enabled in
    modparam; this means that huc_is_supported() can return false on HW that
    does have a HuC when enable_guc=0. The rationale for this behavior is
    that HuC requires GuC for authentication and therefore is not supported
    by itself. However, we do not allow defining HuC fw wthout GuC fw and
    selecting HuC in modparam implicitly selects GuC as well, so we can't
    actually hit a scenario where HuC is selected alone. Therefore, we can
    flip the support check to reflect the HW capabilities and fw
    availability, which is more intuitive and will make it cleaner to log
    HuC the difference between not supported in HW and not selected.
    
    Removing the difference between GuC and HuC also allows us to simplify
    the init_early, since we don't need to differentiate the support based
    on the type of uC.
