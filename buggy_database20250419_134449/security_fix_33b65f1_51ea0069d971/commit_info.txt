Merge tag 'stable/for-linus-3.9-rc4-tag' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/konrad/xen

Pull Xen bug-fixes from Konrad Rzeszutek Wilk:
 "This is mostly just the last stragglers of the regression bugs that
  this merge window had.  There are also two bug-fixes: one that adds an
  extra layer of security, and a regression fix for a change that was
  added in v3.7 (the v1 was faulty, the v2 works).

   - Regression fixes for C-and-P states not being parsed properly.
   - Fix possible security issue with guests triggering DoS via
     non-assigned MSI-Xs.
   - Fix regression (introduced in v3.7) with raising an event (v2).
   - Fix hastily introduced band-aid during c0 for the CR3 blowup."

* tag 'stable/for-linus-3.9-rc4-tag' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/konrad/xen:
  xen/events: avoid race with raising an event in unmask_evtchn()
  xen/mmu: Move the setting of pvops.write_cr3 to later phase in bootup.
  xen/acpi-stub: Disable it b/c the acpi_processor_add is no longer called.
  xen-pciback: notify hypervisor about devices intended to be assigned to guests
  xen/acpi-processor: Don't dereference struct acpi_processor on all CPUs.
