    dmaengine: idxd: Add a new DSA device ID for Granite Rapids-D platform
    
    A new DSA device ID, 0x11fb, is introduced for the Granite Rapids-D
    platform. Add the device ID to the IDXD driver.
    
    Since a potential security issue has been fixed on the new device, it's
    secure to assign the device to virtual machines, and therefore, the new
    device ID will not be added to the VFIO denylist. Additionally, the new
    device ID may be useful in identifying and addressing any other potential
    issues with this specific device in the future. The same is also applied
    to any other new DSA/IAA devices with new device IDs.
