  "body": "A new DSA device ID, 0x11fb, is introduced for the Granite Rapids-D\nplatform. Add the device ID to the IDXD driver.\n\nSince a potential security issue has been fixed on the new device, it's\nsecure to assign the device to virtual machines, and therefore, the new\ndevice ID will not be added to the VFIO denylist. Additionally, the new\ndevice ID may be useful in identifying and addressing any other potential\nissues with this specific device in the future. The same is also applied\nto any other new DSA/IAA devices with new device IDs.\n\nSigned-off-by: Fenghua Yu <fenghua.yu@intel.com>\nReviewed-by: Dave Jiang <dave.jiang@intel.com>\nLink: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20240828233401.186007-2-fenghua.yu@intel.com\nSigned-off-by: Vinod Koul <vkoul@kernel.org>",
