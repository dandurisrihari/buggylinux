    netfs: Move pinning-for-writeback from fscache to netfs
    
    Move the resource pinning-for-writeback from fscache code to netfslib code.
    This is used to keep a cache backing object pinned whilst we have dirty
    pages on the netfs inode in the pagecache such that VM writeback will be
    able to reach it.
    
    Whilst we're at it, switch the parameters of netfs_unpin_writeback() to
    match ->write_inode() so that it can be used for that directly.
    
    Note that this mechanism could be more generically useful than that for
    network filesystems.  Quite often they have to keep around other resources
    (e.g. authentication tokens or network connections) until the writeback is
    complete.
