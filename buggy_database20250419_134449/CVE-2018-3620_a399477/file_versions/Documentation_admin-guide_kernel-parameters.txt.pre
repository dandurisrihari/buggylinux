    x86/KVM: Warn user if KVM is loaded SMT and L1TF CPU bug being present
    
    If the L1TF CPU bug is present we allow the KVM module to be loaded as the
    major of users that use Linux and KVM have trusted guests and do not want a
    broken setup.
    
    Cloud vendors are the ones that are uncomfortable with CVE 2018-3620 and as
    such they are the ones that should set nosmt to one.
    
    Setting 'nosmt' means that the system administrator also needs to disable
    SMT (Hyper-threading) in the BIOS, or via the 'nosmt' command line
    parameter, or via the /sys/devices/system/cpu/smt/control. See commit
    05736e4ac13c ("cpu/hotplug: Provide knobs to control SMT").
    
    Other mitigations are to use task affinity, cpu sets, interrupt binding,
    etc - anything to make sure that _only_ the same guests vCPUs are running
    on sibling threads.
