  "subject": "net: Define usercopy region in struct proto slab cache",
  "body": "In support of usercopy hardening, this patch defines a region in the\nstruct proto slab cache in which userspace copy operations are allowed.\nSome protocols need to copy objects to/from userspace, and they can\ndeclare the region via their proto structure with the new usersize and\nuseroffset fields. Initially, if no region is specified (usersize ==\n0), the entire field is marked as whitelisted. This allows protocols\nto be whitelisted in subsequent patches. Once all protocols have been\nannotated, the full-whitelist default can be removed.\n\nThis region is known as the slab cache's usercopy region. Slab caches\ncan now check that each dynamically sized copy operation involving\ncache-managed memory falls entirely within the slab's usercopy region.\n\nThis patch is modified from Brad Spengler/PaX Team's PAX_USERCOPY\nwhitelisting code in the last public patch of grsecurity/PaX based on my\nunderstanding of the code. Changes or omissions from the original code are\nmine and don't reflect the original grsecurity/PaX code.\n\nSigned-off-by: David Windsor <dave@nullcore.net>\n[kees: adjust commit log, split off per-proto patches]\n[kees: add logic for by-default full-whitelist]\nCc: \"David S.
