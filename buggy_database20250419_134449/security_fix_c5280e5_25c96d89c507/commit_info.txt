Full commit message:
wifi: rtw89: fix authentication fail during scan

We used to store operating channel info after associated. However, scan
might happen before that. Without switching back to operating channel,
authentication or association might fail. Therefore, we switch back to
operating channel when the scanning vif's BSSID is non-zero, which
implies connected or during attempt to connect.
