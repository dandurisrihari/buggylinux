    block: Integrity checksum flag
    
    Make the choice of checksum a per-I/O property by introducing a flag
    that can be inspected by the SCSI layer. There are several reasons for
    this:
    
     1. It allows us to switch choice of checksum without unloading and
        reloading the HBA driver.
    
     2. During error recovery we need to be able to tell the HBA that
        checksums read from disk should not be verified and converted to IP
        checksums.
    
     3. For error injection purposes we need to be able to write a bad guard
        tag to storage. Since the storage device only supports T10 CRC we
        need to be able to disable IP checksum conversion on the HBA.
