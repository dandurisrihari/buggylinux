Merge branch 'master' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/linville/wireless into for-davem

John W. Linville says:

====================
Please pull these fixes intended for 3.6.  There are more commits
here than I would like -- I got a bit behind while I was stalking
Steven Rostedt in San Diego last week...  I'll slow it down after this!

There are a couple of pulls here.  One is from Johannes:

"Please pull (according to the below information) to get a few fixes.

 * a fix to properly disconnect in the driver when authentication or
   association fails
 * a fix to prevent invalid information about mesh paths being reported
   to userspace
 * a memory leak fix in an nl80211 error path"

The other comes via Gustavo:

"A few updates for the 3.6 kernel. There are two btusb patches to add
more supported devices through the new USB_VENDOR_AND_INTEFACE_INFO()
macro and another one that add a new device id for a Sony Vaio laptop,
one fix for a user-after-free and, finally, two patches from Vinicius
to fix a issue in SMP pairing."

Along with those...

Arend van Spriel provides a fix for a use-after-free bug in brcmfmac.

Daniel Drake avoids a hang by not trying to touch the libertas hardware
duing suspend if it is already powered-down.

Felix Fietkau provides a batch of ath9k fixes that adress some
potential problems with power settings, as well as a fix to avoid a
potential interrupt storm.

Gertjan van Wingerde provides a register-width fix for rt2x00, and
a rt2x00 fix to prevent incorrectly detecting the rfkill status.
He also provides a device ID patch.

Hante Meuleman gives us three brcmfmac fixes, one that properly
initializes a command structure, one that fixes a race condition that
could lose usb requests, and one that removes some log spam.

Marc Kleine-Budde offers an rt2x00 fix for a voltage setting on some
specific devices.

Mohammed Shafi Shajakhan sent an ath9k fix to avoid a crash related to
using timers that aren't allocated when 2 wire bluetooth coexistence
hardware is in use.

Sergei Poselenov changes rt2800usb to do some validity checking for
received packets, avoiding crashes on an ARM Soc.

Stone Piao gives us an mwifiex fix for an incorrectly set skb length
value for a command buffer.

All of these are localized to their specific drivers, and relatively
small.  The power-related patches from Felix are bigger than I would
like, but I merged them in consideration of their isolation to ath9k
and the sensitive nature of power settings in wireless devices.
