I'll slow it down after this!\n\nThere are a couple of pulls here.  One is from Johannes:\n\n\"Please pull (according to the below information) to get a few fixes.\n\n * a fix to properly disconnect in the driver when authentication or\n   association fails\n * a fix to prevent invalid information about mesh paths being reported\n   to userspace\n * a memory leak fix in an nl80211 error path\"\n\nThe other comes via Gustavo:\n\n\"A few updates for the 3.6 kernel. There are two btusb patches to add\nmore supported devices through the new USB_VENDOR_AND_INTEFACE_INFO()\nmacro and another one that add a new device id for a Sony Vaio laptop,\none fix for a user-after-free and, finally, two patches from Vinicius\nto fix a issue in SMP pairing.\"\n\nAlong with those...\n\nArend van Spriel provides a fix for a use-after-free bug in brcmfmac.\n\nDaniel Drake avoids a hang by not trying to touch the libertas hardware\nduing suspend if it is already powered-down.\n\nFelix Fietkau provides a batch of ath9k fixes that adress some\npotential problems with power settings, as well as a fix to avoid a\npotential interrupt storm.\n\nGertjan van Wingerde provides a register-width fix for rt2x00, and\na rt2x00 fix to prevent incorrectly detecting the rfkill status.\nHe also provides a device ID patch.\n\nHante Meuleman gives us three brcmfmac fixes, one that properly\ninitializes a command structure, one that fixes a race condition that\ncould lose usb requests, and one that removes some log spam.\n\nMarc Kleine-Budde offers an rt2x00 fix for a voltage setting on some\nspecific devices.\n\nMohammed Shafi Shajakhan sent an ath9k fix to avoid a crash related to\nusing timers that aren't allocated when 2 wire bluetooth coexistence\nhardware is in use.\n\nSergei Poselenov changes rt2800usb to do some validity checking for\nreceived packets, avoiding crashes on an ARM Soc.\n\nStone Piao gives us an mwifiex fix for an incorrectly set skb length\nvalue for a command buffer.\n\nAll of these are localized to their specific drivers, and relatively\nsmall.  The power-related patches from Felix are bigger than I would\nlike, but I merged them in consideration of their isolation to ath9k\nand the sensitive nature of power settings in wireless devices.\n====================\n\nSigned-off-by: David S.
