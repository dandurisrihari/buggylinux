Full commit message:
f2fs: add fs-verity support

Add fs-verity support to f2fs.  fs-verity is a filesystem feature that
enables transparent integrity protection and authentication of read-only
files.  It uses a dm-verity like mechanism at the file level: a Merkle
tree is used to verify any block in the file in log(filesize) time.  It
is implemented mainly by helper functions in fs/verity/.  See
Documentation/filesystems/fsverity.rst for the full documentation.

The f2fs support for fs-verity consists of:

- Adding a filesystem feature flag and an inode flag for fs-verity.

- Implementing the fsverity_operations to support enabling verity on an
  inode and reading/writing the verity metadata.

- Updating ->readpages() to verify data as it's read from verity files
  and to support reading verity metadata pages.

- Updating ->write_begin(), ->write_end(), and ->writepages() to support
  writing verity metadata pages.

- Calling the fs-verity hooks for ->open(), ->setattr(), and ->ioctl().

Like ext4, f2fs stores the verity metadata (Merkle tree and
fsverity_descriptor) past the end of the file, starting at the first 64K
boundary beyond i_size.  This approach works because (a) verity files
are readonly, and (b) pages fully beyond i_size aren't visible to
userspace but can be read/written internally by f2fs with only some
relatively small changes to f2fs.  Extended attributes cannot be used
because (a) f2fs limits the total size of an inode's xattr entries to
4096 bytes, which wouldn't be enough for even a single Merkle tree
block, and (b) f2fs encryption doesn't encrypt xattrs, yet the verity
metadata *must* be encrypted when the file is because it contains hashes
of the plaintext data.
