Full commit message:
mmc: vub300: replace deprecated strncpy with strscpy

`strncpy` is deprecated for use on NUL-terminated destination strings
[1] and as such we should prefer more robust and less ambiguous string
interfaces.

We expect `vub300->vub_name` to be NUL-terminated based on its uses with
format strings:
| 	dev_info(&vub300->udev->dev, "using %s for SDIO offload processing\n",
| 		 vub300->vub_name);

NUL-padding is not needed. We can see cleaning out vub_name simply
consists of:
|       vub300->vub_name[0] = 0;

Considering the above, for all 11 cases a suitable replacement is
`strscpy` [2] due to the fact that it guarantees NUL-termination on the
destination buffer without unnecessarily NUL-padding.

To be clear, there is no existing bug in the current implementation as
the string literals are all small enough as to not cause a buffer
overread. Nonetheless, this gets us 11 steps closer to removing strncpy
uses.
