Full commit message:
x86/static-call: Remove early_boot_irqs_disabled check to fix Xen PVH dom0

__static_call_update_early() has a check for early_boot_irqs_disabled, but
is used before early_boot_irqs_disabled is set up in start_kernel().

Xen PV has always special cased early_boot_irqs_disabled, but Xen PVH does
not and falls over the BUG when booting as dom0.

It is very suspect that early_boot_irqs_disabled starts as 0, becomes 1 for
a time, then becomes 0 again, but as this needs backporting to fix a
breakage in a security fix, dropping the BUG_ON() is the far safer option.
