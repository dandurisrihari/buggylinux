Full commit message:
s390/ipl: refactor deprecated strncpy

`strncpy` is deprecated for use on NUL-terminated destination strings [1].

Use `strscpy` which has the same behavior as `strncpy` here with the
extra safeguard of guaranteeing NUL-termination of destination
strings.  In it's current form, this may result in silent truncation
if the src string has the same size as the destination string.
