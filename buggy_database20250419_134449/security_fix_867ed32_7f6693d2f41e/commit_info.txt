Full commit message:
btrfs: abort the transaction if we fail to inc ref in btrfs_copy_root

While testing my error handling patches, I added a error injection site
at btrfs_inc_extent_ref, to validate the error handling I added was
doing the correct thing.  However I hit a pretty ugly corruption while
doing this check, with the following error injection stack trace:

btrfs_inc_extent_ref
  btrfs_copy_root
    create_reloc_root
      btrfs_init_reloc_root
	btrfs_record_root_in_trans
	  btrfs_start_transaction
	    btrfs_update_inode
	      btrfs_update_time
		touch_atime
		  file_accessed
		    btrfs_file_mmap

This is because we do not catch the error from btrfs_inc_extent_ref,
which in practice would be ENOMEM, which means we lose the extent
references for a root that has already been allocated and inserted,
which is the problem.  Fix this by aborting the transaction if we fail
to do the reference modification.
