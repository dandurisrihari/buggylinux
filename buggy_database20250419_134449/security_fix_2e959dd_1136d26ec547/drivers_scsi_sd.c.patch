    Pull more block updates from Jens Axboe:
     "Some later additions that weren't quite done for the first pull
      request, and also a few fixes that have arrived since.
    
      This contains:
    
       - Kill silly pktcdvd warning on attempting to register a non-scsi
         passthrough device (me)
    
       - Use symbolic constants for the block t10 protection types, and
         switch to handling it in core rather than in the drivers (Max)
    
       - libahci platform missing node put fix (Nishka)
    
       - Small series of fixes for BFQ (Paolo)
    
       - Fix possible nbd crash (Xiubo)"
