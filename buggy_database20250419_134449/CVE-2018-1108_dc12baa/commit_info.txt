CVE Identifiers:
- CVE-2018-1108

Full commit message:
random: use a different mixing algorithm for add_device_randomness()

add_device_randomness() use of crng_fast_load() was highly
problematic.  Some callers of add_device_randomness() can pass in a
large amount of static information.  This would immediately promote
the crng_init state from 0 to 1, without really doing much to
initialize the primary_crng's internal state with something even
vaguely unpredictable.

Since we don't have the speed constraints of add_interrupt_randomness(),
we can do a better job mixing in the what unpredictability a device
driver or architecture maintainer might see fit to give us, and do it
in a way which does not bump the crng_init_cnt variable.

Also, since add_device_randomness() doesn't bump any entropy
accounting in crng_init state 0, mix the device randomness into the
input_pool entropy pool as well.  This is related to CVE-2018-1108.
