Full commit message:
drm/nouveau/core: refactor deprecated strncpy

`strncpy` is deprecated for use on NUL-terminated destination strings [1].

We should prefer more robust and less ambiguous string interfaces.

A suitable replacement is `strscpy` [2] due to the fact that it guarantees
NUL-termination on the destination buffer without unnecessarily NUL-padding.

There is likely no bug in the current implementation due to the safeguard:
| 	cname[sizeof(cname) - 1] = '\0';
... however we can provide simpler and easier to understand code using
the newer (and recommended) `strscpy` api.
