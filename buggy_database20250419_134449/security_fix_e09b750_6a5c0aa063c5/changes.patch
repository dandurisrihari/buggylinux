+Controlling fan speed
+---------------------
+
+The SCH5627 allows for partially controlling the fan speed. If a temperature
+channel excedes tempX_max, all fans are forced to maximum speed. The same is not
+true for tempX_crit, presumably some other measures to cool down the system are
+take in this case.
+In which way the value of fanX_min affects the fan speed is currently unknown.
