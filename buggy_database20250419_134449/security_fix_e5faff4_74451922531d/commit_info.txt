Full commit message:
lguest: fix sense if IF flag on interrupt injection

The sense of the IF bit is backwards in the host interrupt handling.

This means we always save "IF=1" on the stack when injecting an
interrupt.  It turns out this is almost always correct (unless the
guest is taking a page fault in an interrupt due to an unpopulated
vmalloc mapping), so went unnoticed.
