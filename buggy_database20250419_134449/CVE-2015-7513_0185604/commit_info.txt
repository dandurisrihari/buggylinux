CVE Identifiers:
- CVE-2015-7513

Full commit message:
KVM: x86: Reload pit counters for all channels when restoring state

Currently if userspace restores the pit counters with a count of 0
on channels 1 or 2 and the guest attempts to read the count on those
channels, then KVM will perform a mod of 0 and crash.  This will ensure
that 0 values are converted to 65536 as per the spec.

This is CVE-2015-7513.
