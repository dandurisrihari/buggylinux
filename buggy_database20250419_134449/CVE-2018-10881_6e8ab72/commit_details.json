It was not clearing copy of the\ni_blocks[] in ext4_inode_info, in i_data[], which is the copy actually\nused by ext4_map_blocks().\n\nThis didn't matter much if we are using extents, since the extents\nheader would be invalid and thus the extents could would re-initialize\nthe extents tree.  But if we are using indirect blocks, the previous\ncontents of the i_blocks array will be treated as block numbers, with\npotentially catastrophic results to the file system integrity and/or\nuser data.\n\nThis gets worse if the file system is using a 1k block size and\ns_first_data is zero, but even without this, the file system can get\nquite badly corrupted.\n\nThis addresses CVE-2018-10881.\n\nhttps://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=200015\n\nSigned-off-by: Theodore Ts'o <tytso@mit.edu>\nCc: stable@kernel.org",
