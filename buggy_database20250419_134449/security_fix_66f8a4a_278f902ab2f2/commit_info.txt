Full commit message:
hwmon: (ibmpowernv) Replace deprecated strncpy() with memcpy()

`strncpy` is deprecated for use on NUL-terminated destination strings [1].

A suitable replacement is `memcpy` as we've already precisely calculated
the number of bytes to copy while `buf` has been explicitly
zero-initialized:
| 	char buf[8] = { 0 };
