Full commit message:
iio: light: Add check for array bounds in veml6075_read_int_time_ms

The array contains only 5 elements, but the index calculated by
veml6075_read_int_time_index can range from 0 to 7,
which could lead to out-of-bounds access. The check prevents this issue.

Coverity Issue
CID 1574309: (#1 of 1): Out-of-bounds read (OVERRUN)
overrun-local: Overrunning array veml6075_it_ms of 5 4-byte
elements at element index 7 (byte offset 31) using
index int_index (which evaluates to 7)

This is hardening against potentially broken hardware. Good to have
but not necessary to backport.
