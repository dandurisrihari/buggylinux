Subject: keys: Invalidate used request_key authentication keys


Security Keywords:
- authentication

Full commit message:
keys: Invalidate used request_key authentication keys

Invalidate used request_key authentication keys rather than revoking them
so that they get cleaned up immediately rather than potentially hanging
around.  There doesn't seem any need to keep the revoked keys around.
