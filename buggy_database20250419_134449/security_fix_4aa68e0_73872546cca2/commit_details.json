  "body": "When checking for permission to view keys whilst reading from\n/proc/keys, we should use the credentials with which the /proc/keys file\nwas opened.  This is because, in a classic type of exploit, it can be\npossible to bypass checks for the *current* credentials by passing the\nfile descriptor to a suid program.\n\nFollowing commit 34dbbcdbf633 (\"Make file credentials available to the\nseqfile interfaces\") we can finally fix it.
