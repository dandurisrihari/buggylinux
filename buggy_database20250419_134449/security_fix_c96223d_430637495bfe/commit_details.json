Start to change this by\nadding a new set of fault injection op vectors.\n\nFor now they all use the legacy ones. In later patches we'll add new\nroutines that can deal with more granular locking.\n\nAlso, move some of the printk routines into the callers to make the\nresults of the operations more uniform.\n\nSigned-off-by: Jeff Layton <jlayton@primarydata.com>\nSigned-off-by: J.
