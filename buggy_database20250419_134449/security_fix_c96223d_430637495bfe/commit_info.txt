Full commit message:
nfsd: abstract out the get and set routines into the fault injection ops

Now that we've added more granular locking in other places, it's time
to address the fault injection code. This code is currently quite
reliant on the client_mutex for protection. Start to change this by
adding a new set of fault injection op vectors.

For now they all use the legacy ones. In later patches we'll add new
routines that can deal with more granular locking.

Also, move some of the printk routines into the callers to make the
results of the operations more uniform.
