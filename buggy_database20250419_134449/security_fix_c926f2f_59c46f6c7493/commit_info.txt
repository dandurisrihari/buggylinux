Full commit message:
KVM: x86: Protect exit_reason from being used in Spectre-v1/L1TF attacks

This fixes a Spectre-v1/L1TF vulnerability in vmx_handle_exit().
While exit_reason is set by the hardware and therefore should not be
attacker-influenced, an unknown exit_reason could potentially be used to
perform such an attack.
