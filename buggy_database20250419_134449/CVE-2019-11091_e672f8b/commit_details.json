  "body": "Updated the documentation for a new CVE-2019-11091 Microarchitectural Data\nSampling Uncacheable Memory (MDSUM) which is a variant of\nMicroarchitectural Data Sampling (MDS). MDS is a family of side channel\nattacks on internal buffers in Intel CPUs.\n\nMDSUM is a special case of MSBDS, MFBDS and MLPDS. An uncacheable load from\nmemory that takes a fault or assist can leave data in a microarchitectural\nstructure that may later be observed using one of the same methods used by\nMSBDS, MFBDS or MLPDS. There are no new code changes expected for MDSUM.\nThe existing mitigation for MDS applies to MDSUM as well.\n\nSigned-off-by: Pawan Gupta <pawan.kumar.gupta@linux.intel.com>\nSigned-off-by: Thomas Gleixner <tglx@linutronix.de>\nReviewed-by: Tyler Hicks <tyhicks@canonical.com>\nReviewed-by: Jon Masters <jcm@redhat.com>",
