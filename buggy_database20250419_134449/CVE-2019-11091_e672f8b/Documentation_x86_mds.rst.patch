    x86/mds: Add MDSUM variant to the MDS documentation
    
    Updated the documentation for a new CVE-2019-11091 Microarchitectural Data
    Sampling Uncacheable Memory (MDSUM) which is a variant of
    Microarchitectural Data Sampling (MDS). MDS is a family of side channel
    attacks on internal buffers in Intel CPUs.
    
    MDSUM is a special case of MSBDS, MFBDS and MLPDS. An uncacheable load from
    memory that takes a fault or assist can leave data in a microarchitectural
    structure that may later be observed using one of the same methods used by
    MSBDS, MFBDS or MLPDS. There are no new code changes expected for MDSUM.
    The existing mitigation for MDS applies to MDSUM as well.
