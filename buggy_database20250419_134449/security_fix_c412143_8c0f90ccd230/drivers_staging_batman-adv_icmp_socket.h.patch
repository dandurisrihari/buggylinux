    Staging: batman-adv: Move device for icmp injection to debugfs
    
    batctl uses /dev/batman-adv to send special batman-adv icmp packets to
    other nodes in the mesh. To get it working with multiple batX devices we
    must ensure that every mesh device can have their own socket which is
    used to inject those packets in exactly one mesh.
    
    The current implementation still doesn't allow to use complete separated
    meshes as we rely on structures which are not part of the private data
    of a batman device.
