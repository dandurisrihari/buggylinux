  "subject": "perf inject: Hit all DSOs for AUX data in JIT and other cases",
  "body": "Currently, when injecting build ids, if there is AUX data then 'perf\ninject' hits all DSOs because it is not known which DSOs the trace data\nwould hit.\n\nThat needs to be done for JIT injection also, and in fact there is no\nreason to distinguish what kind of injection is being done.  That is,\nany time there is AUX data and the HEADER_BUID_ID feature flag is set,\nand the AUX data is not being processed, then hit all DSOs.  This patch\ndoes that.\n\nSigned-off-by: Adrian Hunter <adrian.hunter@intel.com>\nSigned-off-by: Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo <acme@redhat.com>\nCc: Alexander Shishkin <alexander.shishkin@linux.intel.com>\nCc: David Ahern <dsahern@gmail.com>\nCc: Jiri Olsa <jolsa@redhat.com>\nCc: Namhyung Kim <namhyung@kernel.org>\nCc: Peter Zijlstra <peterz@infradead.org>\nCc: Stephane Eranian <eranian@google.com>\nCc: Thomas Gleixner <tglx@linutronix.de>\nLink: http://lkml.kernel.org/r/1457005856-6143-2-git-send-email-adrian.hunter@intel.com\nSigned-off-by: Ingo Molnar <mingo@kernel.org>",
