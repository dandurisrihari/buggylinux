    groups: Consolidate the setgroups permission checks
    
    Today there are 3 instances of setgroups and due to an oversight their
    permission checking has diverged.  Add a common function so that
    they may all share the same permission checking code.
    
    This corrects the current oversight in the current permission checks
    and adds a helper to avoid this in the future.
    
    A user namespace security fix will update this new helper, shortly.
