    Pull x86 MMIO stale data fixes from Thomas Gleixner:
     "Yet another hw vulnerability with a software mitigation: Processor
      MMIO Stale Data.
    
      They are a class of MMIO-related weaknesses which can expose stale
      data by propagating it into core fill buffers. Data which can then be
      leaked using the usual speculative execution methods.
    
      Mitigations include this set along with microcode updates and are
      similar to MDS and TAA vulnerabilities: VERW now clears those buffers
      too"
