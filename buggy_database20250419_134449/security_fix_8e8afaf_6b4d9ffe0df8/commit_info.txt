Pull x86 MMIO stale data fixes from Thomas Gleixner:
 "Yet another hw vulnerability with a software mitigation: Processor
  MMIO Stale Data.

  They are a class of MMIO-related weaknesses which can expose stale
  data by propagating it into core fill buffers. Data which can then be
  leaked using the usual speculative execution methods.

  Mitigations include this set along with microcode updates and are
  similar to MDS and TAA vulnerabilities: VERW now clears those buffers
  too"
