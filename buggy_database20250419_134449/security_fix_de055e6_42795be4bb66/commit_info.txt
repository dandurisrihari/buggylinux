Full commit message:
bus: fsl-mc: Replace deprecated strncpy() with strscpy_pad()

`strncpy` is deprecated for use on NUL-terminated destination strings [1].

We need to prefer more robust and less ambiguous string interfaces.

`obj_desc->(type|label)` are expected to be NUL-terminated strings as
per "include/linux/fsl/mc.h +143"
| ...
|  * struct fsl_mc_obj_desc - Object descriptor
|  * @type: Type of object: NULL terminated string
| ...

It seems `cmd_params->obj_type` is also expected to be a NUL-terminated string.

A suitable replacement is `strscpy_pad` due to the fact that it
guarantees NUL-termination on the destination buffer whilst keeping the
NUL-padding behavior that `strncpy` provides.

Padding may not strictly be necessary but let's opt to keep it as this
ensures no functional change.
