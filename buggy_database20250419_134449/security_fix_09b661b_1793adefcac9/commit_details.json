This is a security hole because buffer\noverflows can occur if the userspace passes a bigger file than what is\nexpected.\n\nWith this patch, we check if the size of the data passed from\nuserspace matches the size required.\n\nThis bug was introduced in 2.6.36.\n\nCc: stable@kernel.org\nReported-by: Ido Yariv <ido@wizery.com>\nSigned-off-by: Luciano Coelho <coelho@ti.com>\nSigned-off-by: John W.
