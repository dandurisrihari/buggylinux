  "subject": "Bluetooth: Don't enforce authentication for L2CAP PSM 1 and 3",
  "body": "The recommendation for the L2CAP PSM 1 (SDP) is to not use any kind\nof authentication or encryption. So don't trigger authentication\nfor incoming and outgoing SDP connections.\n\nFor L2CAP PSM 3 (RFCOMM) there is no clear requirement, but with\nBluetooth 2.1 the initiator is required to enable authentication\nand encryption first and this gets enforced. So there is no need\nto trigger an additional authentication step. The RFCOMM service\nsecurity will make sure that a secure enough link key is present.\n\nWhen the encryption gets enabled after the SDP connection setup,\nthen switch the security level from SDP to low security.\n\nSigned-off-by: Marcel Holtmann <marcel@holtmann.org>",
