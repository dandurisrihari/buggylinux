Full commit message:
caif: Define usercopy region in caif proto slab cache

The CAIF channel connection request parameters need to be copied to/from
userspace. In support of usercopy hardening, this patch defines a region
in the struct proto slab cache in which userspace copy operations are
allowed.

example usage trace:

    net/caif/caif_socket.c:
        setsockopt(...):
            ...
            copy_from_user(&cf_sk->conn_req.param.data, ..., ol)

This region is known as the slab cache's usercopy region. Slab caches
can now check that each dynamically sized copy operation involving
cache-managed memory falls entirely within the slab's usercopy region.

This patch is modified from Brad Spengler/PaX Team's PAX_USERCOPY
whitelisting code in the last public patch of grsecurity/PaX based on my
understanding of the code. Changes or omissions from the original code are
mine and don't reflect the original grsecurity/PaX code.
