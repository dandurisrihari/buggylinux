Full commit message:
crypto: qat - refactor deprecated strncpy

`strncpy` is deprecated for use on NUL-terminated destination strings [1].

We should prefer more robust and less ambiguous string interfaces.

`buf` is expected to be NUL-terminated for its eventual use in
`kstrtoul()` and NUL-padding is not required.

Due to the above, a suitable replacement is `strscpy` [2] due to the
fact that it guarantees NUL-termination on the destination buffer.
