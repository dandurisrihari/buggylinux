Full commit message:
string: Rewrite and add more kern-doc for the str*() functions

While there were varying degrees of kern-doc for various str*()-family
functions, many needed updating and clarification, or to just be
entirely written. Update (and relocate) existing kern-doc and add missing
functions, sadly shaking my head at how many times I have written "Do
not use this function". Include the results in the core kernel API doc.
