    pidfs: remove config option
    
    As Linus suggested this enables pidfs unconditionally. A key property to
    retain is the ability to compare pidfds by inode number (cf. [1]).
    That's extremely helpful just as comparing namespace file descriptors by
    inode number is. They are used in a variety of scenarios where they need
    to be compared, e.g., when receiving a pidfd via SO_PEERPIDFD from a
    socket to trivially authenticate a the sender and various other
    use-cases.
    
    For 64bit systems this is pretty trivial to do. For 32bit it's slightly
    more annoying as we discussed but we simply add a dumb ida based
    allocator that gets used on 32bit. This gives the same guarantees about
    inode numbers on 64bit without any overflow risk. Practically, we'll
    never run into overflow issues because we're constrained by the number
    of processes that can exist on 32bit and by the number of open files
    that can exist on a 32bit system. On 64bit none of this matters and
    things are very simple.
    
    If 32bit also needs the uniqueness guarantee they can simply parse the
    contents of /proc/<pid>/fd/<nr>. The uniqueness guarantees have a
    variety of use-cases. One of the most obvious ones is that they will
    make pidfiles (or "pidfdfiles", I guess) reliable as the unique
    identifier can be placed into there that won't be reycled. Also a
    frequent request.
    
    Note, I took the chance and simplified path_from_stashed() even further.
    Instead of passing the inode number explicitly to path_from_stashed() we
    let the filesystem handle that internally. So path_from_stashed() ends
    up even simpler than it is now. This is also a good solution allowing
    the cleanup code to be clean and consistent between 32bit and 64bit. The
    cleanup path in prepare_anon_dentry() is also switched around so we put
    the inode before the dentry allocation. This means we only have to call
    the cleanup handler for the filesystem's inode data once and can rely
    ->evict_inode() otherwise.
    
    Aside from having to have a bit of extra code for 32bit it actually ends
    up a nice cleanup for path_from_stashed() imho.
    
    Tested on both 32 and 64bit including error injection.
