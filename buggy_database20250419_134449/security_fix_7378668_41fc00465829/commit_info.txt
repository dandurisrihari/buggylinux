Merge branch 'for-rc' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/rzhang/linux

Pull thermal fixes from Zhang Rui:
 "Specifics:

   - fix an issue in intel_powerclamp driver that idle injection target
     is not accurately maintained on newer Intel CPUs.  Package C8 to
     C10 states are introduced on these CPUs but they were not included
     in the package c-state residency calculation.  From Jacob Pan.

   - fix a problem that package c-state idle injection was missing on
     Broadwell server, by adding its id to intel_powerclamp driver.
     From Jacob Pan.

   - a couple of small fixes and cleanups from Joe Perches, Mathias
     Krause, Dan Carpenter and Anand Moon"
