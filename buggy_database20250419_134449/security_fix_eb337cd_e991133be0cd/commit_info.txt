Full commit message:
arm64: ssbs: Don't treat CPUs with SSBS as unaffected by SSB

SSBS provides a relatively cheap mitigation for SSB, but it is still a
mitigation and its presence does not indicate that the CPU is unaffected
by the vulnerability.

Tweak the mitigation logic so that we report the correct string in sysfs.
