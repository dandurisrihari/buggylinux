Make\nsure we are using 128-bit authentication, since it is the only size\nsupported for hardware offload.  Fixed the transmit trailer length\ncalculation for ipsec by finding the padding value and adding it to the\nauthentication length, then save it off so that we can put it in the\ntransmit descriptor to tell the device where to stop the checksum\ncalculation.  Lastly, cleaned up useless and dead code.\n\nTonghao Zhang adds a ethtool stat for receive length errors, since the\ndriver was already collecting this counter.\n\nArnd Bergmann fixed a warning about an used variable by \"rephrasing\" the\ncode so that the compiler can see the use of the variable in question.\n\nPaul fixes an issue where \"HIDE_VLAN\" was being cleared on VF reset, so\nensure to set \"HIDE_VLAN\" when port VLAN is enabled after a VF reset.\n====================\n\nSigned-off-by: David S.
