====================
10GbE Intel Wired LAN Driver Updates 2018-03-12

This series contains updates to ixgbe and ixgbevf only.

Shannon Nelson provides three fixes to the ipsec portion of ixgbe.  Make
sure we are using 128-bit authentication, since it is the only size
supported for hardware offload.  Fixed the transmit trailer length
calculation for ipsec by finding the padding value and adding it to the
authentication length, then save it off so that we can put it in the
transmit descriptor to tell the device where to stop the checksum
calculation.  Lastly, cleaned up useless and dead code.

Tonghao Zhang adds a ethtool stat for receive length errors, since the
driver was already collecting this counter.

Arnd Bergmann fixed a warning about an used variable by "rephrasing" the
code so that the compiler can see the use of the variable in question.

Paul fixes an issue where "HIDE_VLAN" was being cleared on VF reset, so
ensure to set "HIDE_VLAN" when port VLAN is enabled after a VF reset.
