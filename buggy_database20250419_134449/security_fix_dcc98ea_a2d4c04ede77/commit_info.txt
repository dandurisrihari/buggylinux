Full commit message:
KVM: s390: fixup I/O interrupt traces

We currently have two issues with the I/O  interrupt injection logging:
1. All QEMU versions up to 2.6 have a wrong encoding of device numbers
etc for the I/O interrupt type, so the inject VM_EVENT will have wrong
data. Let's fix this by using the interrupt parameters and not the
interrupt type number.
2. We only log in kvm_s390_inject_vm, but not when coming from
kvm_s390_reinject_io_int or from flic. Let's move the logging to the
common __inject_io function.

We also enhance the logging for delivery to match the data.
