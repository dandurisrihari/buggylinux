  "subject": "net: davinci_emac: switch to new cpdma layer",
  "body": "This patch hooks up the emac driver with the newly separated cpdma driver.\n\nKey differences introduced here:\n\n - The old buffer list scheme is no longer required\n\n - The original code maintained mac address per rx channel, even if only one\n   rx channel was being used.  With this change, mac address is maintained\n   device wide.  If support for multiple rx channels is added in future, this\n   will need to be reworked a bit.\n\n - The new CPDMA code handles short packets better than before.  The\n   earlier code was adjusting the length up, without ensuring that the tail\n   end of the padding was cleared - a possible security issue.  This has been\n   fixed to use skb_padto().\n\nSigned-off-by: Cyril Chemparathy <cyril@ti.com>\nTested-by: Michael Williamson <michael.williamson@criticallink.com>\nTested-by: Caglar Akyuz <caglarakyuz@gmail.com>\nSigned-off-by: Kevin Hilman <khilman@deeprootsystems.com>",
