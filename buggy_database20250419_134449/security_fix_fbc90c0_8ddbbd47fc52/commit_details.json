  "body": "Pull MM updates from Andrew Morton:\n\n - In the series \"mm: Avoid possible overflows in dirty throttling\" Jan\n   Kara addresses a couple of issues in the writeback throttling code.\n   These fixes are also targetted at -stable kernels.\n\n - Ryusuke Konishi's series \"nilfs2: fix potential issues related to\n   reserved inodes\" does that. This should actually be in the\n   mm-nonmm-stable tree, along with the many other nilfs2 patches. My\n   bad.\n\n - More folio conversions from Kefeng Wang in the series \"mm: convert to\n   folio_alloc_mpol()\"\n\n - Kemeng Shi has sent some cleanups to the writeback code in the series\n   \"Add helper functions to remove repeated code and improve readability\n   of cgroup writeback\"\n\n - Kairui Song has made the swap code a little smaller and a little\n   faster in the series \"mm/swap: clean up and optimize swap cache\n   index\".\n\n - In the series \"mm/memory: cleanly support zeropage in\n   vm_insert_page*(), vm_map_pages*() and vmf_insert_mixed()\" David\n   Hildenbrand has reworked the rather sketchy handling of the use of\n   the zeropage in MAP_SHARED mappings. I don't see any runtime effects\n   here - more a cleanup/understandability/maintainablity thing.\n\n - Dev Jain has improved selftests/mm/va_high_addr_switch.c's handling\n   of higher addresses, for aarch64. The (poorly named) series is\n   \"Restructure va_high_addr_switch\".\n\n - The core TLB handling code gets some cleanups and possible slight\n   optimizations in Bang Li's series \"Add update_mmu_tlb_range() to\n   simplify code\".\n\n - Jane Chu has improved the handling of our\n   fake-an-unrecoverable-memory-error testing feature MADV_HWPOISON in\n   the series \"Enhance soft hwpoison handling and injection\".\n\n - Jeff Johnson has sent a billion patches everywhere to add\n   MODULE_DESCRIPTION() to everything. Some landed in this pull.\n\n - In the series \"mm: cleanup MIGRATE_SYNC_NO_COPY mode\", Kefeng Wang\n   has simplified migration's use of hardware-offload memory copying.\n\n - Yosry Ahmed performs more folio API conversions in his series \"mm:\n   zswap: trivial folio conversions\".\n\n - In the series \"large folios swap-in: handle refault cases first\",\n   Chuanhua Han inches us forward in the handling of large pages in the\n   swap code. This is a cleanup and optimization, working toward the end\n   objective of full support of large folio swapin/out.\n\n - In the series \"mm,swap: cleanup VMA based swap readahead window\n   calculation\", Huang Ying has contributed some cleanups and a possible\n   fixlet to his VMA based swap readahead code.\n\n - In the series \"add mTHP support for anonymous shmem\" Baolin Wang has\n   taught anonymous shmem mappings to use multisize THP. By default this\n   is a no-op - users must opt in vis sysfs controls. Dramatic\n   improvements in pagefault latency are realized.\n\n - David Hildenbrand has some cleanups to our remaining use of\n   page_mapcount() in the series \"fs/proc: move page_mapcount() to\n   fs/proc/internal.h\".\n\n - David also has some highmem accounting cleanups in the series\n   \"mm/highmem: don't track highmem pages manually\".\n\n - Build-time fixes and cleanups from John Hubbard in the series\n   \"cleanups, fixes, and progress towards avoiding \"make headers\"\".\n\n - Cleanups and consolidation of the core pagemap handling from Barry\n   Song in the series \"mm: introduce pmd|pte_needs_soft_dirty_wp helpers\n   and utilize them\".\n\n - Lance Yang's series \"Reclaim lazyfree THP without splitting\" has\n   reduced the latency of the reclaim of pmd-mapped THPs under fairly\n   common circumstances. A 10x speedup is seen in a microbenchmark.\n\n   It does this by punting to aother CPU but I guess that's a win unless\n   all CPUs are pegged.\n\n - hugetlb_cgroup cleanups from Xiu Jianfeng in the series\n   \"mm/hugetlb_cgroup: rework on cftypes\".\n\n - Miaohe Lin's series \"Some cleanups for memory-failure\" does just that\n   thing.\n\n - Someone other than SeongJae has developed a DAMON feature in Honggyu\n   Kim's series \"DAMON based tiered memory management for CXL memory\".\n   This adds DAMON features which may be used to help determine the\n   efficiency of our placement of CXL/PCIe attached DRAM.\n\n - DAMON user API centralization and simplificatio work in SeongJae\n   Park's series \"mm/damon: introduce DAMON parameters online commit\n   function\".\n\n - In the series \"mm: page_type, zsmalloc and page_mapcount_reset()\"\n   David Hildenbrand does some maintenance work on zsmalloc - partially\n   modernizing its use of pageframe fields.\n\n - Kefeng Wang provides more folio conversions in the series \"mm: remove\n   page_maybe_dma_pinned() and page_mkclean()\".\n\n - More cleanup from David Hildenbrand, this time in the series\n   \"mm/memory_hotplug: use PageOffline() instead of PageReserved() for\n   !ZONE_DEVICE\". It \"enlightens memory hotplug more about PageOffline()\n   pages\" and permits the removal of some virtio-mem hacks.\n\n - Barry Song's series \"mm: clarify folio_add_new_anon_rmap() and\n   __folio_add_anon_rmap()\" is a cleanup to the anon folio handling in\n   preparation for mTHP (multisize THP) swapin.\n\n - Kefeng Wang's series \"mm: improve clear and copy user folio\"\n   implements more folio conversions, this time in the area of large\n   folio userspace copying.\n\n - The series \"Docs/mm/damon/maintaier-profile: document a mailing tool\n   and community meetup series\" tells people how to get better involved\n   with other DAMON developers. From SeongJae Park.\n\n - A large series (\"kmsan: Enable on s390\") from Ilya Leoshkevich does\n   that.\n\n - David Hildenbrand sends along more cleanups, this time against the\n   migration code. The series is \"mm/migrate: move NUMA hinting fault\n   folio isolation + checks under PTL\".\n\n - Jan Kara has found quite a lot of strangenesses and minor errors in\n   the readahead code. He addresses this in the series \"mm: Fix various\n   readahead quirks\".\n\n - SeongJae Park's series \"selftests/damon: test DAMOS tried regions and\n   {min,max}_nr_regions\" adds features and addresses errors in DAMON's\n   self testing code.\n\n - Gavin Shan has found a userspace-triggerable WARN in the pagecache\n   code. The series \"mm/filemap: Limit page cache size to that supported\n   by xarray\" addresses this. The series is marked cc:stable.\n\n - Chengming Zhou's series \"mm/ksm: cmp_and_merge_page() optimizations\n   and cleanup\" cleans up and slightly optimizes KSM.\n\n - Roman Gushchin has separated the memcg-v1 and memcg-v2 code - lots of\n   code motion. The series (which also makes the memcg-v1 code\n   Kconfigurable) are \"mm: memcg: separate legacy cgroup v1 code and put\n   under config option\" and \"mm: memcg: put cgroup v1-specific memcg\n   data under CONFIG_MEMCG_V1\"\n\n - Dan Schatzberg's series \"Add swappiness argument to memory.reclaim\"\n   adds an additional feature to this cgroup-v2 control file.\n\n - The series \"Userspace controls soft-offline pages\" from Jiaqi Yan\n   permits userspace to stop the kernel's automatic treatment of\n   excessive correctable memory errors. In order to permit userspace to\n   monitor and handle this situation.\n\n - Kefeng Wang's series \"mm: migrate: support poison recover from\n   migrate folio\" teaches the kernel to appropriately handle migration\n   from poisoned source folios rather than simply panicing.\n\n - SeongJae Park's series \"Docs/damon: minor fixups and improvements\"\n   does those things.\n\n - In the series \"mm/zsmalloc: change back to per-size_class lock\"\n   Chengming Zhou improves zsmalloc's scalability and memory\n   utilization.\n\n - Vivek Kasireddy's series \"mm/gup: Introduce memfd_pin_folios() for\n   pinning memfd folios\" makes the GUP code use FOLL_PIN rather than\n   bare refcount increments. So these paes can first be moved aside if\n   they reside in the movable zone or a CMA block.\n\n - Andrii Nakryiko has added a binary ioctl()-based API to\n   /proc/pid/maps for much faster reading of vma information. The series\n   is \"query VMAs from /proc/<pid>/maps\".\n\n - In the series \"mm: introduce per-order mTHP split counters\" Lance\n   Yang improves the kernel's presentation of developer information\n   related to multisize THP splitting.\n\n - Michael Ellerman has developed the series \"Reimplement huge pages\n   without hugepd on powerpc (8xx, e500, book3s/64)\".
