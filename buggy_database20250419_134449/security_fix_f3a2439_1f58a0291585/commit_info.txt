Merge tag 'rproc-v6.3' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/remoteproc/linux

Pull remoteproc updates from Bjorn Andersson:

 - Support for PRU clients to acquire a control reference to the PRU
   instances is introduced, and the PRU now allows specifying
   firmware-name in Devicetree. sysfs is requested to be read-only when
   the remoteproc instance is consumed by another kernel driver

 - Support for the C7xv DSP on AM62A SoC is introduced

 - The Devicetree binding for the Qualcomm PAS devices are split up in
   multiple files, to better account for the differences in resources
   between them. A number of missing Devicetree bindings are added, and
   the Qualcomm WCNSS binding is converted to YAML

 - A few cleanups are introduced for the Mediatek SCP driver. And a
   sanity check of the firmware image is introduced in the Mediatek
   driver

 - For Qualcomm SC7280 ADSP support is added, MSM8953 gains ADSP and
   modem support, SM6115 and SM8550 gains ADSP, CDSP and modem support,
   and support for pronto v3 support (used on e.g. MSM8953) is added

 - The Qualcomm modem remoteproc driver is modified to use a no-map
   reserved-memory region for it's authentication metadata, in order to
   avoid fatal security violations caused by accesses from Linux during
   the authentication process

 - Support for separate loading of a Devicetree blob is added to the PAS
   driver, and support for the PAS driver to carve out DSM memory for
   the modem is added as well

 - The Qualcomm ADSP remoteproc driver gains support for mapping memory
   into specific range using the IOMMU. The sysmon driver is
   transitioned to strlcpy()
