Full commit message:
EDAC/versal: Make the bit position of injected errors configurable

Currently, the bit positions to inject correctable and uncorrectable
errors are hardcoded. To make that configurable add separate sysfs entries
to set the bit positions for injecting CE and UE errors. Allow for
single bit error for CE and two bits errors for UE injection.
