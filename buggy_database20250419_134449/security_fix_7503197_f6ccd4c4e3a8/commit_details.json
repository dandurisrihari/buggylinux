  "subject": "arm64: add basic pointer authentication support",
  "body": "This patch adds basic support for pointer authentication, allowing\nuserspace to make use of APIAKey, APIBKey, APDAKey, APDBKey, and\nAPGAKey. The kernel maintains key values for each process (shared by all\nthreads within), which are initialised to random values at exec() time.\n\nThe ID_AA64ISAR1_EL1.{APA,API,GPA,GPI} fields are exposed to userspace,\nto describe that pointer authentication instructions are available and\nthat the kernel is managing the keys. Two new hwcaps are added for the\nsame reason: PACA (for address authentication) and PACG (for generic\nauthentication).\n\nReviewed-by: Richard Henderson <richard.henderson@linaro.org>\nSigned-off-by: Mark Rutland <mark.rutland@arm.com>\nSigned-off-by: Kristina Martsenko <kristina.martsenko@arm.com>\nTested-by: Adam Wallis <awallis@codeaurora.org>\nCc: Catalin Marinas <catalin.marinas@arm.com>\nCc: Ramana Radhakrishnan <ramana.radhakrishnan@arm.com>\nCc: Suzuki K Poulose <suzuki.poulose@arm.com>\nCc: Will Deacon <will.deacon@arm.com>\n[will: Fix sizeof() usage and unroll address key initialisation]\nSigned-off-by: Will Deacon <will.deacon@arm.com>",
