    arm64: add basic pointer authentication support
    
    This patch adds basic support for pointer authentication, allowing
    userspace to make use of APIAKey, APIBKey, APDAKey, APDBKey, and
    APGAKey. The kernel maintains key values for each process (shared by all
    threads within), which are initialised to random values at exec() time.
    
    The ID_AA64ISAR1_EL1.{APA,API,GPA,GPI} fields are exposed to userspace,
    to describe that pointer authentication instructions are available and
    that the kernel is managing the keys. Two new hwcaps are added for the
    same reason: PACA (for address authentication) and PACG (for generic
    authentication).
