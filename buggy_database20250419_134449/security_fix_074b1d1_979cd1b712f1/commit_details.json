  "body": "Now that the use of numeric uids/gids is officially sanctioned in\nRFC3530bis, it is time to change the default here to 'enabled'.\n\nBy doing so, we ensure that NFSv4 copies the behaviour of NFSv3 when we're\nusing the default AUTH_SYS authentication (i.e. when the client uses the\nnumeric uids/gids as authentication tokens), so that when new files are\ncreated, they will appear to have the correct user/group.\nIt also fixes a number of backward compatibility issues when migrating\nfrom NFSv3 to NFSv4 on a platform where the server uses different uid/gid\nmappings than the client.\n\nNote also that this setting has been successfully tested against servers\nthat do not support numeric uids/gids at several Connectathon/Bakeathon\nevents at this point, and the fall back to using string names/groups has\nbeen shown to work well in all those test cases.\n\nSigned-off-by: Trond Myklebust <Trond.Myklebust@netapp.com>",
