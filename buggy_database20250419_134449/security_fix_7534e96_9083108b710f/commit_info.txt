Full commit message:
wifi: iwlwifi: mvm: support injection antenna control

Pull up the injection rate control one layer, and let it
control the antenna settings as well. Since mac80211 has
already checked that enough antennas are configured, and
we only have two bits, it's enough to just copy the data
over.
