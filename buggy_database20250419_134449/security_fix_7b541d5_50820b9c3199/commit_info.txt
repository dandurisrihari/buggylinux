Full commit message:
Merge tag 'kvmarm-6.13' of https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/kvmarm/kvmarm into HEAD

KVM/arm64 changes for 6.13, part #1

 - Support for stage-1 permission indirection (FEAT_S1PIE) and
   permission overlays (FEAT_S1POE), including nested virt + the
   emulated page table walker

 - Introduce PSCI SYSTEM_OFF2 support to KVM + client driver. This call
   was introduced in PSCIv1.3 as a mechanism to request hibernation,
   similar to the S4 state in ACPI

 - Explicitly trap + hide FEAT_MPAM (QoS controls) from KVM guests. As
   part of it, introduce trivial initialization of the host's MPAM
   context so KVM can use the corresponding traps

 - PMU support under nested virtualization, honoring the guest
   hypervisor's trap configuration and event filtering when running a
   nested guest

 - Fixes to vgic ITS serialization where stale device/interrupt table
   entries are not zeroed when the mapping is invalidated by the VM

 - Avoid emulated MMIO completion if userspace has requested synchronous
   external abort injection

 - Various fixes and cleanups affecting pKVM, vCPU initialization, and
   selftests
