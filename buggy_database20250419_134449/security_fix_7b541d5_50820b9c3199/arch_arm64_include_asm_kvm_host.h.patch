    Merge tag 'kvmarm-6.13' of https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/kvmarm/kvmarm into HEAD
    
    KVM/arm64 changes for 6.13, part #1
    
     - Support for stage-1 permission indirection (FEAT_S1PIE) and
       permission overlays (FEAT_S1POE), including nested virt + the
       emulated page table walker
    
     - Introduce PSCI SYSTEM_OFF2 support to KVM + client driver. This call
       was introduced in PSCIv1.3 as a mechanism to request hibernation,
       similar to the S4 state in ACPI
    
     - Explicitly trap + hide FEAT_MPAM (QoS controls) from KVM guests. As
       part of it, introduce trivial initialization of the host's MPAM
       context so KVM can use the corresponding traps
    
     - PMU support under nested virtualization, honoring the guest
       hypervisor's trap configuration and event filtering when running a
       nested guest
    
     - Fixes to vgic ITS serialization where stale device/interrupt table
       entries are not zeroed when the mapping is invalidated by the VM
    
     - Avoid emulated MMIO completion if userspace has requested synchronous
       external abort injection
    
     - Various fixes and cleanups affecting pKVM, vCPU initialization, and
       selftests
