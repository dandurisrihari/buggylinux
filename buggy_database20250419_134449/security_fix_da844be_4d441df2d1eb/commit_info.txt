Full commit message:
arm64: cpufeature: Account min_field_value when cheking secondaries for PAuth

In case, both boot_val and sec_val have value below min_field_value we
would wrongly report that address authentication is supported. It is
not a big issue because we enable address authentication based on boot
cpu (and check there is correct).
