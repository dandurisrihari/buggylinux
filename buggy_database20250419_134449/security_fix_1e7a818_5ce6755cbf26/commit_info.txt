Full commit message:
mm, fault-injection: declare should_fail_alloc_page()

The mm/ directory can almost fully be built with W=1, which would help
in local development.  One remaining issue is missing prototype for
should_fail_alloc_page().  Thus add it next to the should_failslab()
prototype.

Note the previous attempt by commit f7173090033c ("mm/page_alloc: make
should_fail_alloc_page() static") had to be reverted by commit
54aa386661fe as it caused an unresolved symbol error with
CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF=y
