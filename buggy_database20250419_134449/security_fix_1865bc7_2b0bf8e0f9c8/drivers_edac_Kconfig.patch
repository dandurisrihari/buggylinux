    EDAC/amd64: Limit error injection functionality to supported hw
    
    Families up to and including 0x16 allow access to the injection
    hardware. Starting with family 0x17, access to those registers is
    blocked by security policy.
    
    Limit that only on the families which support it.

 	  When EDAC_DEBUG is enabled, hardware error injection facilities
 	  through sysfs are available:
 
-	  Recent Opterons (Family 10h and later) provide for Memory Error
-	  Injection into the ECC detection circuits. The amd64_edac module
-	  allows the operator/user to inject Uncorrectable and Correctable
-	  errors into DRAM.

 	  When enabled, in each of the respective memory controller directories
 	  (/sys/devices/system/edac/mc/mcX), there are 3 input files:
