John W. Linville says:

====================
Included is a Bluetooth pull -- Gustavo says:

"These are the Bluetooth bits for inclusion in 3.8, there is basically one big
thing here which is the High Speed patches from Andrei, he did a lot of work on
A2MP and management of AMP devices. The rest are mostly clean up and bug
fixes."

Also included is an NFC pull -- Samuel says:

"With this one we have:

- pn544 p2p support.
- pn544 physical and HCI layers separation. We are getting the pn544 driver
  ready to support non i2c physical layers.
- LLCP SNL (Service Name Lookup). This is the NFC p2p service discovery
  protocol.
- LLCP datagram sockets (connection less) support.
- IDR library usage for NFC devices indexes assignement.
- NFC netlink extension for setting and getting LLCP link characteristics.
- Various code style fixes and cleanups spread over the pn533, LLCP, HCI and
  pn544 code."

There are a couple of mac80211 pulls as well -- Johannes says:

"Please pull my mac80211-next tree to get the first round of new features
for 3.8. We have:
 * finally, the mac80211 multi-channel work
 * scan improvements:
   - bg scan
   - scan flush
   - forced AP scan
 * cfg80211 tracing
 * a bit of new code to allow implementing SAE (secure authentication of
   equals) in managed mode

Along with a few random improvements, features and fixes."

and...

"Please pull from mac80211-next (per below pull request) to get a few
updates. Most important is probably the fix for the WDS regression that
my previous pull request introduced. Other than that, I have some
tracing code, two mesh updates and a change to allow drivers to
calculate the AES CMAC subkeys without having to implement the GF_mulx
operation themselves."

On top of that are the usual updates to iwlwifi, ath9k, rt2x00,
brcmfmac, mwifiex, and a few others here and there.  Of note is the
addition of the ar5523 driver, ported from an original FreeBSD driver.
