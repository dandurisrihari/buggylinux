Full commit message:
compat_ioctl: don't call do_ioctl under set_fs(KERNEL_DS)

This replaces all code in fs/compat_ioctl.c that translated
ioctl arguments into a in-kernel structure, then performed
do_ioctl under set_fs(KERNEL_DS), with code that allocates
data on the user stack and can call the VFS ioctl handler
under USER_DS.

This is done as a hardening measure because the caller
does not know what kind of ioctl handler will be invoked,
only that no corresponding compat_ioctl handler exists and
what the ioctl command number is. The accidental
invocation of an unlocked_ioctl handler that unexpectedly
calls copy_to_user could be a severe security issue.
