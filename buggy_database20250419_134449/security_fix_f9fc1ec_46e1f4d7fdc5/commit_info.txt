Full commit message:
crypto: drivers - avoid memcpy size warning

Some configurations with gcc-12 or gcc-13 produce a warning for the source
and destination of a memcpy() in atmel_sha_hmac_compute_ipad_hash() potentially
overlapping:

The same thing happens in two more drivers that have the same logic:

drivers/crypto/chelsio/chcr_algo.c: In function 'chcr_ahash_setkey':
include/linux/fortify-string.h:57:33: error: '__builtin_memcpy' accessing 129 or more bytes at offsets 260 and 132 overlaps 1 or more bytes at offset 260 [-Werror=restrict]
drivers/crypto/bcm/cipher.c: In function 'ahash_hmac_setkey':
include/linux/fortify-string.h:57:33: error: '__builtin_memcpy' accessing between 129 and 4294967295 bytes at offsets 840 and 712 overlaps between 1 and 4294967167 bytes at offset 840 [-Werror=restrict]

I don't think it can actually happen because the size is strictly bounded
to the available block sizes, at most 128 bytes, though inlining decisions
could lead gcc to not see that.

Use the unsafe_memcpy() helper instead of memcpy(), with the only difference
being that this skips the hardening checks that produce the warning.
