Pull networking fixes from David Miller:

 1) sunhme driver lacks DMA mapping error checks, based upon a report by
    Meelis Roos.

 2) Fix memory leak in mvpp2 driver, from Sudip Mukherjee.

 3) DMA memory allocation sizes are wrong in systemport ethernet driver,
    fix from Florian Fainelli.

 4) Fix use after free in mac80211 defragmentation code, from Johannes
    Berg.

 5) Some networking uapi headers missing from Kbuild file, from Stephen
    Hemminger.

 6) TUN driver gets csum_start offset wrong when VLAN accel is enabled,
    and macvtap has a similar bug, from Herbert Xu.

 7) Adjust several tunneling drivers to set dev->iflink after registry,
    because registry sets that to -1 overwriting whatever we did.  From
    Steffen Klassert.

 8) Geneve forgets to set inner tunneling type, causing GSO segmentation
    to fail on some NICs.  From Jesse Gross.

 9) Fix several locking bugs in stmmac driver, from Fabrice Gasnier and
    Giuseppe CAVALLARO.

10) Fix spurious timeouts with NewReno on low traffic connections, from
    Marcelo Leitner.

11) Fix descriptor updates in enic driver, from Govindarajulu
    Varadarajan.

12) PPP calls bpf_prog_create() with locks held, which isn't kosher.
    Fix from Takashi Iwai.

13) Fix NULL deref in SCTP with malformed INIT packets, from Daniel
    Borkmann.

14) psock_fanout selftest accesses past the end of the mmap ring, fix
    from Shuah Khan.

15) Fix PTP timestamping for VLAN packets, from Richard Cochran.

16) netlink_unbind() calls in netlink pass wrong initial argument, from
    Hiroaki SHIMODA.

17) vxlan socket reuse accidently reuses a socket when the address
    family is different, so we have to explicitly check this, from
    Marcelo Lietner.

18) Fix missing include in nft_reject_bridge.c breaking the build on ppc
    and other architectures, from Guenter Roeck.
