Full commit message:
Bluetooth: Add selection of the SC authentication method

This patch adds code to select the authentication method for Secure
Connections based on the local and remote capabilities. A new
DSP_PASSKEY method is also added for displaying the passkey - something
that is not part of legacy SMP pairing.
