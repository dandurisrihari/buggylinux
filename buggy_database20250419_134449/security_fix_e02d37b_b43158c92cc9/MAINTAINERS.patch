    Pull sound updates from Takashi Iwai:
     "This became a large update. The changes are scattered widely, and the
      majority of them are attributed to ASoC componentization. The gitk
      output made me dizzy, but it's slightly better than London tube.
    
      OK, below are some highlights:
    
       - Continued hardening works in ALSA PCM core; most of the existing
         syzkaller reports should have been covered.
    
       - USB-audio got the initial USB Audio Class 3 support, as well as
         UAC2 jack detection support and more DSD-device support.
    
       - ASoC componentization: finally each individual driver was converted
         to components framework, which is more future-proof for further
         works. Most of conversations were systematic.
    
       - Lots of fixes for Intel Baytrail / Cherrytrail devices with Realtek
         codecs, typically tablets and small PCs.
    
       - Fixes / cleanups for Samsung Odroid systems
    
       - Cleanups in Freescale SSI driver
    
       - New ASoC drivers:
          * AKM AK4458 and AK5558 codecs
          * A few AMD based machine drivers
          * Intel Kabylake machine drivers
          * Maxim MAX9759 codec
          * Motorola CPCAP codec
          * Socionext Uniphier SoCs
          * TI PCM1789 and TDA7419 codecs
    
       - Retirement of Blackfin drivers along with architecture removal"
