Full commit message:
KVM: arm/arm64: use vcpu requests for irq injection

Don't use request-less VCPU kicks when injecting IRQs, as a VCPU
kick meant to trigger the interrupt injection could be sent while
the VCPU is outside guest mode, which means no IPI is sent, and
after it has called kvm_vgic_flush_hwstate(), meaning it won't see
the updated GIC state until its next exit some time later for some
other reason.  The receiving VCPU only needs to check this request
in VCPU RUN to handle it.  By checking it, if it's pending, a
memory barrier will be issued that ensures all state is visible.
See "Ensuring Requests Are Seen" of
Documentation/virtual/kvm/vcpu-requests.rst
