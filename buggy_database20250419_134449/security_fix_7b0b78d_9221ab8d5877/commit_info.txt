Full commit message:
Merge branch 'userns-for-v5.12' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/ebiederm/user-namespace

Pull user namespace update from Eric Biederman:
 "There are several pieces of active development, but only a single
  change made it through the gauntlet to be ready for v5.12. That change
  is tightening up the semantics of the v3 capabilities xattr. It is
  just short of being a bug-fix/security issue as no user space is known
  to even generate the problem case"

* 'userns-for-v5.12' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/ebiederm/user-namespace:
  capabilities: Don't allow writing ambiguous v3 file capabilities
