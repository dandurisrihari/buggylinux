    Merge branch 'userns-for-v5.12' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/ebiederm/user-namespace
    
    Pull user namespace update from Eric Biederman:
     "There are several pieces of active development, but only a single
      change made it through the gauntlet to be ready for v5.12. That change
      is tightening up the semantics of the v3 capabilities xattr. It is
      just short of being a bug-fix/security issue as no user space is known
      to even generate the problem case"
