    net/mlx5e: IPSec, Add Innova IPSec offload RX data path
    
    In RX data path, the hardware prepends a special metadata ethertype
    which indicates that the packet underwent decryption, and the result of
    the authentication check.
    
    Communicate this to the stack in skb->sp.
    
    Make wqe_size large enough to account for the injected metadata.
    
    Support only Linked-list RQ type.
    
    IPSec offload RX packets may have useful CHECKSUM_COMPLETE information,
    which the stack may not be able to use yet.
