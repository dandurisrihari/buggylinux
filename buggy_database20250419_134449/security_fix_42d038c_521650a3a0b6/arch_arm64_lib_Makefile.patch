    arm64: Add support for function error injection
    
    Inspired by the commit 7cd01b08d35f ("powerpc: Add support for function
    error injection"), this patch supports function error injection for
    Arm64.
    
    This patch mainly support two functions: one is regs_set_return_value()
    which is used to overwrite the return value; the another function is
    override_function_with_return() which is to override the probed
    function returning and jump to its caller.
