    [CVE-2009-0029] Convert all system calls to return a long
    
    Convert all system calls to return a long. This should be a NOP since all
    converted types should have the same size anyway.
    With the exception of sys_exit_group which returned void. But that doesn't
    matter since the system call doesn't return.
