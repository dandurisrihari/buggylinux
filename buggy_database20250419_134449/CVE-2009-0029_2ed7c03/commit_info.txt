Full commit message:
[CVE-2009-0029] Convert all system calls to return a long

Convert all system calls to return a long. This should be a NOP since all
converted types should have the same size anyway.
With the exception of sys_exit_group which returned void. But that doesn't
matter since the system call doesn't return.
