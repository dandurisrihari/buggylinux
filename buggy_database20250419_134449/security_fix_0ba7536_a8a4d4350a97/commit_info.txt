[PATCH] knfsd: Fix some minor sign problems in nfsd/xdr

There are a couple of tests which could possibly be confused by extremely
large numbers appearing in 'xdr' packets.  I think the closest to an exploit
you could get would be writing random data from a free page into a file - i.e.
 leak data out of kernel space.

I'm fairly sure they cannot be used for remote compromise.
