    [PATCH] knfsd: Fix some minor sign problems in nfsd/xdr
    
    There are a couple of tests which could possibly be confused by extremely
    large numbers appearing in 'xdr' packets.  I think the closest to an exploit
    you could get would be writing random data from a free page into a file - i.e.
     leak data out of kernel space.
    
    I'm fairly sure they cannot be used for remote compromise.
