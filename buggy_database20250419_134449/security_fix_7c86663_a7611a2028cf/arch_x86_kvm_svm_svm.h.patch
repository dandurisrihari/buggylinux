    KVM: nSVM: inject exceptions via svm_check_nested_events
    
    This allows exceptions injected by the emulator to be properly delivered
    as vmexits.  The code also becomes simpler, because we can just let all
    L0-intercepted exceptions go through the usual path.  In particular, our
    emulation of the VMX #DB exit qualification is very much simplified,
    because the vmexit injection path can use kvm_deliver_exception_payload
    to update DR6.
