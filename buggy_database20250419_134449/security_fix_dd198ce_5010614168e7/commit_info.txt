Merge branch 'for-linus' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/ebiederm/user-namespace

Pull namespace updates from Eric Biederman:
 "Life has been busy and I have not gotten half as much done this round
  as I would have liked. I delayed it so that a minor conflict
  resolution with the mips tree could spend a little time in linux-next
  before I sent this pull request.

  This includes two long delayed user namespace changes from Kirill
  Tkhai. It also includes a very useful change from Serge Hallyn that
  allows the security capability attribute to be used inside of user
  namespaces. The practical effect of this is people can now untar
  tarballs and install rpms in user namespaces. It had been suggested to
  generalize this and encode some of the namespace information
  information in the xattr name. Upon close inspection that makes the
  things that should be hard easy and the things that should be easy
  more expensive.

  Then there is my bugfix/cleanup for signal injection that removes the
  magic encoding of the siginfo union member from the kernel internal
  si_code. The mips folks reported the case where I had used FPE_FIXME
  me is impossible so I have remove FPE_FIXME from mips, while at the
  same time including a return statement in that case to keep gcc from
  complaining about unitialized variables.

  I almost finished the work to get make copy_siginfo_to_user a trivial
  copy to user. The code is available at:

     git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/ebiederm/user-namespace.git neuter-copy_siginfo_to_user-v3

  But I did not have time/energy to get the code posted and reviewed
  before the merge window opened.

  I was able to see that the security excuse for just copying fields
  that we know are initialized doesn't work in practice there are buggy
  initializations that don't initialize the proper fields in siginfo. So
  we still sometimes copy unitialized data to userspace"

* 'for-linus' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/ebiederm/user-namespace:
  Introduce v3 namespaced file capabilities
  mips/signal: In force_fcr31_sig return in the impossible case
  signal: Remove kernel interal si_code magic
  fcntl: Don't use ambiguous SIG_POLL si_codes
  prctl: Allow local CAP_SYS_ADMIN changing exe_file
  security: Use user_namespace::level to avoid redundant iterations in cap_capable()
  userns,pidns: Verify the userns for new pid namespaces
  signal/testing: Don't look for __SI_FAULT in userspace
  signal/mips: Document a conflict with SI_USER with SIGFPE
  signal/sparc: Document a conflict with SI_USER with SIGFPE
  signal/ia64: Document a conflict with SI_USER with SIGFPE
  signal/alpha: Document a conflict with SI_USER for SIGTRAP
