Full commit message:
kvm: iommu: fix the third parameter of kvm_iommu_put_pages (CVE-2014-3601)

The third parameter of kvm_iommu_put_pages is wrong,
It should be 'gfn - slot->base_gfn'.

By making gfn very large, malicious guest or userspace can cause kvm to
go to this error path, and subsequently to pass a huge value as size.
Alternatively if gfn is small, then pages would be pinned but never
unpinned, causing host memory leak and local DOS.

Passing a reasonable but large value could be the most dangerous case,
because it would unpin a page that should have stayed pinned, and thus
allow the device to DMA into arbitrary memory.  However, this cannot
happen because of the condition that can trigger the error:

- out of memory (where you can't allocate even a single page)
  should not be possible for the attacker to trigger

- when exceeding the iommu's address space, guest pages after gfn
  will also exceed the iommu's address space, and inside
  kvm_iommu_put_pages() the iommu_iova_to_phys() will fail.  The
  page thus would not be unpinned at all.
