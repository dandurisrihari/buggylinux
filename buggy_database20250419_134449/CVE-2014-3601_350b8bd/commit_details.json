  "body": "The third parameter of kvm_iommu_put_pages is wrong,\nIt should be 'gfn - slot->base_gfn'.\n\nBy making gfn very large, malicious guest or userspace can cause kvm to\ngo to this error path, and subsequently to pass a huge value as size.\nAlternatively if gfn is small, then pages would be pinned but never\nunpinned, causing host memory leak and local DOS.\n\nPassing a reasonable but large value could be the most dangerous case,\nbecause it would unpin a page that should have stayed pinned, and thus\nallow the device to DMA into arbitrary memory.  However, this cannot\nhappen because of the condition that can trigger the error:\n\n- out of memory (where you can't allocate even a single page)\n  should not be possible for the attacker to trigger\n\n- when exceeding the iommu's address space, guest pages after gfn\n  will also exceed the iommu's address space, and inside\n  kvm_iommu_put_pages() the iommu_iova_to_phys() will fail.  The\n  page thus would not be unpinned at all.\n\nReported-by: Jack Morgenstein <jackm@mellanox.com>\nCc: stable@vger.kernel.org\nSigned-off-by: Michael S.
