Full commit message:
KVM: s390: protvirt: Add program exception injection

Only two program exceptions can be injected for a protected guest:
specification and operand.

For both, a code needs to be specified in the interrupt injection
control of the state description, as the guest prefix page is not
accessible to KVM for such guests.
