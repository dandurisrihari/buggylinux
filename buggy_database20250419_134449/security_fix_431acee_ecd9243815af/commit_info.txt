Full commit message:
ibmvnic: replace deprecated strncpy with strscpy

`strncpy` is deprecated for use on NUL-terminated destination strings
[1] and as such we should prefer more robust and less ambiguous string
interfaces.

NUL-padding is not required as the buffer is already memset to 0:
|       memset(adapter->fw_version, 0, 32);

Note that another usage of strscpy exists on the same buffer:
|       strscpy((char *)adapter->fw_version, "N/A", sizeof(adapter->fw_version));

Considering the above, a suitable replacement is `strscpy` [2] due to
the fact that it guarantees NUL-termination on the destination buffer
without unnecessarily NUL-padding.
