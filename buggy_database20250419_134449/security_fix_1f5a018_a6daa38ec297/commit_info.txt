Full commit message:
Merge branch 'fixes-v5.1-rc6' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jmorris/linux-security

Pull keys fixes from James Morris:

 - Handle quotas better, allowing full quota to be reached.

 - Fix the creation of shortcuts in the assoc_array internal
   representation when the index key needs to be an exact multiple of
   the machine word size.

 - Fix a dependency loop between the request_key contruction record and
   the request_key authentication key. The construction record isn't
   really necessary and can be dispensed with.

 - Set the timestamp on a new key rather than leaving it as 0. This
   would ordinarily be fine - provided the system clock is never set to
   a time before 1970
