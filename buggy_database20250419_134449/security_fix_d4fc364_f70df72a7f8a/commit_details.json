  "body": "Since commit c5089591c3ba (\"block, bfq: detect wakers and\nunconditionally inject their I/O\"), when the in-service bfq_queue, say\nQ, is temporarily empty, BFQ checks whether there are I/O requests to\ninject (also) from the waker bfq_queue for Q. To this goal, the value\npointed by bfqq->waker_bfqq->next_rq must be controlled. However, the\ncurrent implementation mistakenly looks at bfqq->next_rq, which\ninstead points to the next request of the currently served queue.\n\nThis mistake evidently causes losses of throughput in scenarios with\nwaker bfq_queues.\n\nThis commit corrects this mistake.\n\nFixes: c5089591c3ba (\"block, bfq: detect wakers and unconditionally inject their I/O\")\nSigned-off-by: Jia Cheng Hu <jia.jiachenghu@gmail.com>\nSigned-off-by: Jan Kara <jack@suse.cz>\nSigned-off-by: Paolo Valente <paolo.valente@linaro.org>\nSigned-off-by: Jens Axboe <axboe@kernel.dk>",
