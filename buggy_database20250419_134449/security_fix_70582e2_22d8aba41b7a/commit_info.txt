Full commit message:
wifi: iwlwifi: fw: replace deprecated strncpy with strscpy_pad

strncpy() is deprecated for use on NUL-terminated destination strings
[1] and as such we should prefer more robust and less ambiguous string
interfaces.

Based on the deliberate `sizeof(dest) ... - 1` pattern we can see that
both dump_info->dev_human_readable and dump_info->bus_human_readable are
intended to be NUL-terminated.

Moreover, since this seems to cross the file boundary let's NUL-pad to
ensure no behavior change.

strscpy_pad() covers both the NUL-termination and NUL-padding, let's use
it.
