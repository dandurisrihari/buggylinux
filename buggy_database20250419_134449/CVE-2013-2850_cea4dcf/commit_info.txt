CVE Identifiers:
- CVE-2013-2850

Full commit message:
iscsi-target: fix heap buffer overflow on error

If a key was larger than 64 bytes, as checked by iscsi_check_key(), the
error response packet, generated by iscsi_add_notunderstood_response(),
would still attempt to copy the entire key into the packet, overflowing
the structure on the heap.

Remote preauthentication kernel memory corruption was possible if a
target was configured and listening on the network.
