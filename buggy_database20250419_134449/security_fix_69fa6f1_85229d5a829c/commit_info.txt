ALSA: hda: Hardening for potential Spectre v1

As recently Smatch suggested, one place in HD-audio hwdep ioctl codes
may expand the array directly from the user-space value with
speculation:
  sound/pci/hda/hda_local.h:467 get_wcaps() warn: potential spectre issue 'codec->wcaps'

As get_wcaps() itself is a fairly frequently called inline function,
and there is only one single call with a user-space value, we replace
only the latter one to open-code locally with array_index_nospec()
hardening in this patch.
