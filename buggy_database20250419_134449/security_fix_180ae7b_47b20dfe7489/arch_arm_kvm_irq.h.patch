    KVM: arm/arm64: Enable irqchip routing
    
    This patch adds compilation and link against irqchip.
    
    Main motivation behind using irqchip code is to enable MSI
    routing code. In the future irqchip routing may also be useful
    when targeting multiple irqchips.
    
    Routing standard callbacks now are implemented in vgic-irqfd:
    - kvm_set_routing_entry
    - kvm_set_irq
    - kvm_set_msi
    
    They only are supported with new_vgic code.
    
    Both HAVE_KVM_IRQCHIP and HAVE_KVM_IRQ_ROUTING are defined.
    KVM_CAP_IRQ_ROUTING is advertised and KVM_SET_GSI_ROUTING is allowed.
    
    So from now on IRQCHIP routing is enabled and a routing table entry
    must exist for irqfd injection to succeed for a given SPI. This patch
    builds a default flat irqchip routing table (gsi=irqchip.pin) covering
    all the VGIC SPI indexes. This routing table is overwritten by the
    first first user-space call to KVM_SET_GSI_ROUTING ioctl.
    
    MSI routing setup is not yet allowed.
