Subject: gcc-plugins: Add structleak for more stack initialization

CVE Identifiers:
- CVE-2013-2141

Full commit message:
gcc-plugins: Add structleak for more stack initialization

This plugin detects any structures that contain __user attributes and
makes sure it is being fully initialized so that a specific class of
information exposure is eliminated. (This plugin was originally designed
to block the exposure of siginfo in CVE-2013-2141.)

Ported from grsecurity/PaX. This version adds a verbose option to the
plugin and the Kconfig.
