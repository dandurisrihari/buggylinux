CVE Identifiers:
- CVE-2019-3016

Full commit message:
x86/kvm: Introduce kvm_(un)map_gfn()

kvm_vcpu_(un)map operates on gfns from any current address space.
In certain cases we want to make sure we are not mapping SMRAM
and for that we can use kvm_(un)map_gfn() that we are introducing
in this patch.

This is part of CVE-2019-3016.
