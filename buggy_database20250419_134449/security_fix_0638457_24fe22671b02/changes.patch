 					that is being referenced (e.g hdd0, hdd1 etc)
 					This attribute defaults to device 0.
 
+		certificate:
+		signature:
+		save_signature:
+					These attributes are used for certificate based authentication. This is
+					used in conjunction with a signing server as an alternative to password
+					based authentication.
+					The user writes to the attribute(s) with a BASE64 encoded string obtained
+					from the signing server.
+					The attributes can be displayed to check the stored value.
+
+					Some usage examples:
+					Installing a certificate to enable feature:
+						echo <supervisor password > authentication/Admin/current_password
+						echo <signed certificate> > authentication/Admin/certificate
+
+					Updating the installed certificate:
+						echo <signature> > authentication/Admin/signature
+						echo <signed certificate> > authentication/Admin/certificate
+
+					Removing the installed certificate:
+						echo <signature> > authentication/Admin/signature
+						echo '' > authentication/Admin/certificate
+
+					Changing a BIOS setting:
+						echo <signature> > authentication/Admin/signature
+						echo <save signature> > authentication/Admin/save_signature
+						echo Enable > attribute/PasswordBeep/current_value
+
+					You cannot enable certificate authentication if a supervisor password
+					has not been set.
+					Clearing the certificate results in no bios-admin authentication method
+					being configured allowing anyone to make changes.
+					After any of these operations the system must reboot for the changes to
+					take effect.
+
+		certificate_thumbprint:
+					Read only attribute used to display the MD5, SHA1 and SHA256 thumbprints
+					for the certificate installed in the BIOS.
+
+		certificate_to_password:
+					Write only attribute used to switch from certificate based authentication
+					back to password based.
+					Usage:
+						echo <signature> > authentication/Admin/signature
+						echo <password> > authentication/Admin/certificate_to_password
