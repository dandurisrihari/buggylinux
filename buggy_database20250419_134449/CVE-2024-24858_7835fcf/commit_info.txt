Full commit message:
Bluetooth: Fix TOCTOU in HCI debugfs implementation

struct hci_dev members conn_info_max_age, conn_info_min_age,
le_conn_max_interval, le_conn_min_interval, le_adv_max_interval,
and le_adv_min_interval can be modified from the HCI core code, as well
through debugfs.

The debugfs implementation, that's only available to privileged users,
will check for boundaries, making sure that the minimum value being set
is strictly above the maximum value that already exists, and vice-versa.

However, as both minimum and maximum values can be changed concurrently
to us modifying them, we need to make sure that the value we check is
the value we end up using.

For example, with ->conn_info_max_age set to 10, conn_info_min_age_set()
gets called from vfs handlers to set conn_info_min_age to 8.

In conn_info_min_age_set(), this goes through:
	if (val == 0 || val > hdev->conn_info_max_age)
		return -EINVAL;

Concurrently, conn_info_max_age_set() gets called to set to set the
conn_info_max_age to 7:
	if (val == 0 || val > hdev->conn_info_max_age)
		return -EINVAL;
That check will also pass because we used the old value (10) for
conn_info_max_age.

After those checks that both passed, the struct hci_dev access
is mutex-locked, disabling concurrent access, but that does not matter
because the invalid value checks both passed, and we'll end up with
conn_info_min_age = 8 and conn_info_max_age = 7

To fix this problem, we need to lock the structure access before so the
check and assignment are not interrupted.

This fix was originally devised by the BassCheck[1] team, and
considered the problem to be an atomicity one. This isn't the case as
there aren't any concerns about the variable changing while we check it,
but rather after we check it parallel to another change.

This patch fixes CVE-2024-24858 and CVE-2024-24857.
