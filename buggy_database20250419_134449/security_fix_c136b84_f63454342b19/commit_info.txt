Merge tag 'for-linus' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/virt/kvm/kvm

Pull KVM updates from Paolo Bonzini:
 "PPC:
   - Better machine check handling for HV KVM
   - Ability to support guests with threads=2, 4 or 8 on POWER9
   - Fix for a race that could cause delayed recognition of signals
   - Fix for a bug where POWER9 guests could sleep with interrupts pending.

  ARM:
   - VCPU request overhaul
   - allow timer and PMU to have their interrupt number selected from userspace
   - workaround for Cavium erratum 30115
   - handling of memory poisonning
   - the usual crop of fixes and cleanups

  s390:
   - initial machine check forwarding
   - migration support for the CMMA page hinting information
   - cleanups and fixes

  x86:
   - nested VMX bugfixes and improvements
   - more reliable NMI window detection on AMD
   - APIC timer optimizations

  Generic:
   - VCPU request overhaul + documentation of common code patterns
   - kvm_stat improvements"
