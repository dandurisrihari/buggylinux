    Pull rdma fixes from Doug Ledford:
     "Final set of -rc fixes for 4.6.
    
      I've collected up a number of patches that are all pretty small with
      the exception of only a couple.  The hfi1 driver has a number of
      important patches, and it is what really drives the line count of this
      pull request up.  These are all small and I've got this kernel built
      and running in the test lab (I have most of the hardware, I think nes
      is the only thing in this patch set that I can't say I've personally
      tested and have up and running).
    
      Summary:
    
       - A number of collected fixes for oopses, memory corruptions,
         deadlocks, etc.  All of these fixes are small (many only 5-10
         lines), obvious, and tested.
    
       - Fix for the security issue related to the use of write for
         bi-directional communications"
