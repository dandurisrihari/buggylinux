Full commit message:
KVM: x86: Trace re-injected exceptions

Trace exceptions that are re-injected, not just those that KVM is
injecting for the first time.  Debugging re-injection bugs is painful
enough as is, not having visibility into what KVM is doing only makes
things worse.

Delay propagating pending=>injected in the non-reinjection path so that
the tracing can properly identify reinjected exceptions.
