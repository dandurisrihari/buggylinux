Full commit message:
ibmvmc: replace deprecated strncpy with strscpy

`strncpy` is deprecated for use on NUL-terminated destination strings
[1] and as such we should prefer more robust and less ambiguous string
interfaces.

A suitable replacement is `strscpy` [2] due to the fact that it
guarantees NUL-termination on the destination buffer without
unnecessarily NUL-padding.
