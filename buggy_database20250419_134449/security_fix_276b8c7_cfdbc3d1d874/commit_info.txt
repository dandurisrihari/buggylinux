====================
NFC 4.8 pull request

This is the first NFC pull request for 4.8. We have:

- A fairly large NFC digital stack patchset:
  * RTOX fixes.
  * Proper DEP RWT support.
  * ACK and NACK PDUs handling fixes, in both initiator
    and target modes.
  * A few memory leak fixes.

- A conversion of the nfcsim driver to use the digital stack.
  The driver supports the DEP protocol in both NFC-A and NFC-F.

- Error injection through debugfs for the nfcsim driver.

- Improvements to the port100 driver for the Sony USB chipset, in
  particular to the command abort and cancellation code paths.

- A few minor fixes for the pn533, trf7970a and fdp drivers.
