Full commit message:
error-injection: Separate error-injection from kprobe

Since error-injection framework is not limited to be used
by kprobes, nor bpf. Other kernel subsystems can use it
freely for checking safeness of error-injection, e.g.
livepatch, ftrace etc.
So this separate error-injection framework from kprobes.

Some differences has been made:

- "kprobe" word is removed from any APIs/structures.
- BPF_ALLOW_ERROR_INJECTION() is renamed to
  ALLOW_ERROR_INJECTION() since it is not limited for BPF too.
- CONFIG_FUNCTION_ERROR_INJECTION is the config item of this
  feature. It is automatically enabled if the arch supports
  error injection feature for kprobe or ftrace etc.
