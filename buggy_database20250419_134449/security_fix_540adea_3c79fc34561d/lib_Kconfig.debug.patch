    error-injection: Separate error-injection from kprobe
    
    Since error-injection framework is not limited to be used
    by kprobes, nor bpf. Other kernel subsystems can use it
    freely for checking safeness of error-injection, e.g.
    livepatch, ftrace etc.
    So this separate error-injection framework from kprobes.
    
    Some differences has been made:
    
    - "kprobe" word is removed from any APIs/structures.
    - BPF_ALLOW_ERROR_INJECTION() is renamed to
      ALLOW_ERROR_INJECTION() since it is not limited for BPF too.
    - CONFIG_FUNCTION_ERROR_INJECTION is the config item of this
      feature. It is automatically enabled if the arch supports
      error injection feature for kprobe or ftrace etc.
