Merge tag 'i3c/for-6.12' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/i3c/linux

Pull i3c updates from Alexandre Belloni:
 "This adds support for the I3C HCI controller of the AMD SoC which as
  expected requires quirks. Also fixes for the other drivers, including
  rate selection fixes for svc.

  Core:
   - allow adjusting first broadcast address speed

  Drivers:
   - cdns: few fixes
   - mipi-i3c-hci: Add AMD SoC I3C controller support and quirks, fix
     get_i3c_mode
   - svc: adjust rates, fix race condition"
