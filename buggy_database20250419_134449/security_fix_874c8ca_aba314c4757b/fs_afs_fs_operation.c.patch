    netfs: Fix gcc-12 warning by embedding vfs inode in netfs_i_context
    
    While randstruct was satisfied with using an open-coded "void *" offset
    cast for the netfs_i_context <-> inode casting, __builtin_object_size() as
    used by FORTIFY_SOURCE was not as easily fooled.  This was causing the
    following complaint[1] from gcc v12:
    
      In file included from include/linux/string.h:253,
                       from include/linux/ceph/ceph_debug.h:7,
                       from fs/ceph/inode.c:2:
      In function 'fortify_memset_chk',
          inlined from 'netfs_i_context_init' at include/linux/netfs.h:326:2,
          inlined from 'ceph_alloc_inode' at fs/ceph/inode.c:463:2:
      include/linux/fortify-string.h:242:25: warning: call to '__write_overflow_field' declared with attribute warning: detected write beyond size of field (1st parameter); maybe use struct_group()? [-Wattribute-warning]
        242 |                         __write_overflow_field(p_size_field, size);
            |                         ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
    Fix this by embedding a struct inode into struct netfs_i_context (which
    should perhaps be renamed to struct netfs_inode).  The struct inode
    vfs_inode fields are then removed from the 9p, afs, ceph and cifs inode
    structs and vfs_inode is then simply changed to "netfs.inode" in those
    filesystems.
    
    Further, rename netfs_i_context to netfs_inode, get rid of the
    netfs_inode() function that converted a netfs_i_context pointer to an
    inode pointer (that can now be done with &ctx->inode) and rename the
    netfs_i_context() function to netfs_inode() (which is now a wrapper
    around container_of()).
    
    Most of the changes were done with:
    
      perl -p -i -e 's/vfs_inode/netfs.inode/'g \
            `git grep -l 'vfs_inode' -- fs/{9p,afs,ceph,cifs}/*.[ch]`
    
    Kees suggested doing it with a pair structure[2] and a special
    declarator to insert that into the network filesystem's inode
    wrapper[3], but I think it's cleaner to embed it - and then it doesn't
    matter if struct randomisation reorders things.
    
    Dave Chinner suggested using a filesystem-specific VFS_I() function in
    each filesystem to convert that filesystem's own inode wrapper struct
    into the VFS inode struct[4].
    
    Version #2:
     - Fix a couple of missed name changes due to a disabled cifs option.
     - Rename nfs_i_context to nfs_inode
     - Use "netfs" instead of "nic" as the member name in per-fs inode wrapper
       structs.
    
    [ This also undoes commit 507160f46c55 ("netfs: gcc-12: temporarily
      disable '-Wattribute-warning' for now") that is no longer needed ]
