    PCI AER: software error injection
    
    Debugging PCIE AER code can be very difficult because it is hard
    to trigger various real hardware errors. This patch provide a
    software based error injection tool, which can fake various PCIE
    errors with a user space helper tool named "aer-inject". Which
    can be gotten from:
    
      http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/yhuang/
    
    The patch fakes AER error by faking some PCIE AER related
    registers and an AER interrupt for specified the PCIE device.
