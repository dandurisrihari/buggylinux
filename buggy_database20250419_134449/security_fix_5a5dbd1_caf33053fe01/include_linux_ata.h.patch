    libata: add support for READ/WRITE LONG
    
    The READ/WRITE LONG commands are theoretically obsolete,
    but the majority of drives in existance still implement them.
    
    The WRITE_LONG and WRITE_LONG_ONCE commands are of particular
    interest for fault injection testing -- eg. creating "media errors"
    at specific locations on a disk.
    
    The fussy bit is that these commands require a non-standard
    sector size, usually 520 bytes instead of 512.
    
    This patch adds support to libata for READ/WRITE LONG commands
    issued via SG_IO/ATA_16.
