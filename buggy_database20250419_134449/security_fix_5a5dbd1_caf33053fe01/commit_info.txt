Full commit message:
libata: add support for READ/WRITE LONG

The READ/WRITE LONG commands are theoretically obsolete,
but the majority of drives in existance still implement them.

The WRITE_LONG and WRITE_LONG_ONCE commands are of particular
interest for fault injection testing -- eg. creating "media errors"
at specific locations on a disk.

The fussy bit is that these commands require a non-standard
sector size, usually 520 bytes instead of 512.

This patch adds support to libata for READ/WRITE LONG commands
issued via SG_IO/ATA_16.
