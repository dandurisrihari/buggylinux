    KVM: arm/arm64: add irqfd support
    
    This patch enables irqfd on arm/arm64.
    
    Both irqfd and resamplefd are supported. Injection is implemented
    in vgic.c without routing.
    
    This patch enables CONFIG_HAVE_KVM_EVENTFD and CONFIG_HAVE_KVM_IRQFD.
    
    KVM_CAP_IRQFD is now advertised. KVM_CAP_IRQFD_RESAMPLE capability
    automatically is advertised as soon as CONFIG_HAVE_KVM_IRQFD is set.
    
    Irqfd injection is restricted to SPI. The rationale behind not
    supporting PPI irqfd injection is that any device using a PPI would
    be a private-to-the-CPU device (timer for instance), so its state
    would have to be context-switched along with the VCPU and would
    require in-kernel wiring anyhow. It is not a relevant use case for
    irqfds.
