    ACPI, APEI, APEI supporting infrastructure
    
    APEI stands for ACPI Platform Error Interface, which allows to report
    errors (for example from the chipset) to the operating system. This
    improves NMI handling especially. In addition it supports error
    serialization and error injection.
    
    For more information about APEI, please refer to ACPI Specification
    version 4.0, chapter 17.
    
    This patch provides some common functions used by more than one APEI
    tables, mainly framework of interpreter for EINJ and ERST.
    
    A machine readable language is defined for EINJ and ERST for OS to
    execute, and so to drive the firmware to fulfill the corresponding
    functions. The machine language for EINJ and ERST is compatible, so a
    common framework is defined for them.
