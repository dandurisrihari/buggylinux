Full commit message:
Documentation/ABI: Mention retbleed vulnerability info file for sysfs

While reporting for the AMD retbleed vulnerability was added in

  6b80b59b3555 ("x86/bugs: Report AMD retbleed vulnerability")

the new sysfs file was not mentioned so far in the ABI documentation for
sysfs-devices-system-cpu. Fix that.
