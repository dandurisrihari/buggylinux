    dt-bindings: remoteproc: qcom,sc7280-mss-pil: Update memory-region
    
    The dynamic memory region used for metadata authentication would still
    be a part of the kernel mapping and any access to this region by the
    application processor after assigning it to the remote Q6 will result
    in a XPU violation. This is fixed by using a no-map carveout instead.
    Update the bindings to reflect the addition of the new modem metadata
    carveout on SC7280 SoC.
