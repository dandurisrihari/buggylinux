Full commit message:
KVM: arm64: ITS: return 1 on successful MSI injection

According to the KVM API documentation a successful MSI injection
should return a value > 0 on success.
Return possible errors in vgic_its_trigger_msi() and report a
successful injection back to userland, while also reporting the
case where the MSI could not be delivered due to the guest not
having the LPI mapped, for instance.
