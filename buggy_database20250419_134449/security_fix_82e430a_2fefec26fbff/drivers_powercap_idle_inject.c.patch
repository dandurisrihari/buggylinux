    cpuidle: play_idle: Increase the resolution to usec
    
    The play_idle resolution is 1ms. The intel_powerclamp bases the idle
    duration on jiffies. The idle injection API is also using msec based
    duration but has no user yet.
    
    Unfortunately, msec based time does not fit well when we want to
    inject idle cycle precisely with shallow idle state.
    
    In order to set the scene for the incoming idle injection user, move
    the precision up to usec when calling play_idle.
