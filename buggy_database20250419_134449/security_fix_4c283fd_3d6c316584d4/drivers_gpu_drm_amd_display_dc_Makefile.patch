    drm/amd/display: Add HDCP module
    
    This module manages HDCP for amdgpu driver. The module behaves as a
    state machine which handles the different authentication states of HDCP
    
    The module is divided into 3 major components
    +--------+
    | Hdcp.c |
    +--------+
    Manages the state machine, sends the events to be executed and communicates
    with the dm
    
    +-----------+
    |Execution.c|
    +-----------+
    This executes events based on the current state. Also generates
    execution results as transition inputs
    
    +------------+
    |Transition.c|
    +------------+
    Decides the next state based on the input and makes requests to
    hdcp.c to handle.
                                    +-------------+
                            ------> | Execution.c | ------
                            |       +-------------+       |
                            |                             V
    +----+              +--------+                 +--------------+
    | DM |    ----->    | Hdcp.c |  <------------  | Transition.c |
    +----+    <-----    +--------+                 +--------------+
