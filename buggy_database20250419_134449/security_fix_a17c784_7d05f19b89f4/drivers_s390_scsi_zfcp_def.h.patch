    scsi: zfcp: report FC Endpoint Security in sysfs
    
    Add an interface to read Fibre Channel Endpoint Security information of FCP
    channels and their connections to FC remote ports. It comes in the form of
    new sysfs attributes that are attached to the CCW device representing the
    FCP device and its zfcp port objects.
    
    The read-only sysfs attribute "fc_security" of a CCW device representing a
    FCP device shows the FC Endpoint Security capabilities of the device.
    Possible values are: "unknown", "unsupported", "none", or a comma-
    separated list of one or more mnemonics and/or one hexadecimal value
    representing the supported FC Endpoint Security:
    
      Authentication: Authentication supported
      Encryption    : Encryption supported
    
    The read-only sysfs attribute "fc_security" of a zfcp port object shows the
    FC Endpoint Security used on the connection between its parent FCP device
    and the FC remote port. Possible values are: "unknown", "unsupported",
    "none", or a mnemonic or hexadecimal value representing the FC Endpoint
    Security used:
    
      Authentication: Connection has been authenticated
      Encryption    : Connection is encrypted
    
    Both sysfs attributes may return hexadecimal values instead of mnemonics,
    if the mnemonic lookup table does not contain an entry for the FC Endpoint
    Security reported by the FCP device.
