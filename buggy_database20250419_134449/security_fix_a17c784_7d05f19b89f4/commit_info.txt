Full commit message:
scsi: zfcp: report FC Endpoint Security in sysfs

Add an interface to read Fibre Channel Endpoint Security information of FCP
channels and their connections to FC remote ports. It comes in the form of
new sysfs attributes that are attached to the CCW device representing the
FCP device and its zfcp port objects.

The read-only sysfs attribute "fc_security" of a CCW device representing a
FCP device shows the FC Endpoint Security capabilities of the device.
Possible values are: "unknown", "unsupported", "none", or a comma-
separated list of one or more mnemonics and/or one hexadecimal value
representing the supported FC Endpoint Security:

  Authentication: Authentication supported
  Encryption    : Encryption supported

The read-only sysfs attribute "fc_security" of a zfcp port object shows the
FC Endpoint Security used on the connection between its parent FCP device
and the FC remote port. Possible values are: "unknown", "unsupported",
"none", or a mnemonic or hexadecimal value representing the FC Endpoint
Security used:

  Authentication: Connection has been authenticated
  Encryption    : Connection is encrypted

Both sysfs attributes may return hexadecimal values instead of mnemonics,
if the mnemonic lookup table does not contain an entry for the FC Endpoint
Security reported by the FCP device.
