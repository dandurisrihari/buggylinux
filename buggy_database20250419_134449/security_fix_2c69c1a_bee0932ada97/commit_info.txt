Full commit message:
Merge tag 'kvm-s390-next-20140910' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/kvms390/linux into kvm-next

KVM: s390: Fixes and features for next (3.18)

1. Crypto/CPACF support: To enable the MSA4 instructions we have to
   provide a common control structure for each SIE control block
2. Two cleanups found by a static code checker: one redundant assignment
   and one useless if
3. Fix the page handling of the diag10 ballooning interface. If the
   guest freed the pages at absolute 0 some checks and frees were
   incorrect
4. Limit guests to 16TB
5. Add __must_check to interrupt injection code
