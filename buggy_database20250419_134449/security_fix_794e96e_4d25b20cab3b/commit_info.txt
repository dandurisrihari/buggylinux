Merge tag 'edac_for_3.13' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/bp/bp

Pull EDAC updates from Borislav Petkov:
 "Following up on last week's discussion, here's my part of the EDAC
  pile, highlights in the signed tag.

  The last two patches have a date from just now because I've just
  applied them to the tree after Johannes sent them to me earlier.  I
  decided to forward them now because they're trivial.

  There's a third one for MPC85xx which adds PCIe error interrupt
  support but since it is not so trivial and hasn't seen any linux-next
  time, I'm deferring it to 3.14

  EDAC update highlights:
   - Support for Calxeda ECX-2000 memory controller, from Robert Richter
   - Misc Calxeda Highbank drivers and EDAC core cleanups, from Rob
     Herring and Robert Richter
   - New maintainer for Freescale's MPC85xx EDAC driver: Johannes
     Thumshirn"
