CVE Identifiers:
- CVE-2018-10879

Full commit message:
ext4: add corruption check in ext4_xattr_set_entry()

In theory this should have been caught earlier when the xattr list was
verified, but in case it got missed, it's simple enough to add check
to make sure we don't overrun the xattr buffer.

This addresses CVE-2018-10879.
