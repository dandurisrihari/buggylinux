drm/i915/pxp: Separate PXP FW interface structures for both v42 and 43

Previously, we only used PXP FW interface version-42 structures for
PXP arbitration session on ADL/TGL products and version-43 for HuC
authentication on DG2. That worked fine despite not differentiating such
versioning of the PXP firmware interaction structures. This was okay
back then because the only commands used via version 42 was not
used via version 43 and vice versa.

With MTL, we'll need both these versions side by side for the same
commands (PXP-session) with the older platform feature support. That
said, let's create separate files to define the structures and definitions
for both version-42 and 43 of PXP FW interfaces.
