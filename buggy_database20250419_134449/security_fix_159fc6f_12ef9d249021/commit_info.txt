Full commit message:
KVM: nSVM: Transparently handle L1 -> L2 NMI re-injection

A NMI that L1 wants to inject into its L2 should be directly re-injected,
without causing L0 side effects like engaging NMI blocking for L1.

It's also worth noting that in this case it is L1 responsibility
to track the NMI window status for its L2 guest.
