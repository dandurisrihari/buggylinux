Full commit message:
IB/nes: Return an error on ib_copy_from_udata() failure instead of NULL

In case of error while accessing to userspace memory, function
nes_create_qp() returns NULL instead of an error code wrapped through
ERR_PTR().  But NULL is not expected by ib_uverbs_create_qp(), as it
check for error with IS_ERR().

As page 0 is likely not mapped, it is going to trigger an Oops when
the kernel will try to dereference NULL pointer to access to struct
ib_qp's fields.

In some rare cases, page 0 could be mapped by userspace, which could
turn this bug to a vulnerability that could be exploited: the function
pointers in struct ib_device will be under userspace total control.

This was caught when using spatch (aka. coccinelle)
to rewrite calls to ib_copy_{from,to}_udata().
