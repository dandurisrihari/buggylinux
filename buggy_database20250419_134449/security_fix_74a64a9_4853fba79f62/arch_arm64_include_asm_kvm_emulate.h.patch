    KVM: arm/arm64: Unify 32bit fault injection
    
    Both arm and arm64 implementations are capable of injecting
    faults, and yet have completely divergent implementations,
    leading to different bugs and reduced maintainability.
    
    Let's elect the arm64 version as the canonical one
    and move it into aarch32.c, which is common to both
    architectures.
