ubifs: Add helper functions for authentication support

This patch adds the various helper functions needed for authentication
support. We need functions to hash nodes, to embed HMACs into a node and
to compare hashes and HMACs. Most functions first check if this
filesystem is authenticated and bail out early if not, which makes the
functions safe to be called with disabled authentication.
