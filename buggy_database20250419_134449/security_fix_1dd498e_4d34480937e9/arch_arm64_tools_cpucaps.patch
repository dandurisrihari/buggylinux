    KVM: arm64: Workaround Cortex-A510's single-step and PAC trap errata
    
    Cortex-A510's erratum #2077057 causes SPSR_EL2 to be corrupted when
    single-stepping authenticated ERET instructions. A single step is
    expected, but a pointer authentication trap is taken instead. The
    erratum causes SPSR_EL1 to be copied to SPSR_EL2, which could allow
    EL1 to cause a return to EL2 with a guest controlled ELR_EL2.
    
    Because the conditions require an ERET into active-not-pending state,
    this is only a problem for the EL2 when EL2 is stepping EL1. In this case
    the previous SPSR_EL2 value is preserved in struct kvm_vcpu, and can be
    restored.
