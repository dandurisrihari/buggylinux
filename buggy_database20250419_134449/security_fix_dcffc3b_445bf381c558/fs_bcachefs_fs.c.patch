    bcachefs: Split up bch_dev.io_ref
    
    We now have separate per device io_refs for read and write access.
    
    This fixes a device removal bug where the discard workers were still
    running while we're removing alloc info for that device.
    
    It's also a bit of hardening; we no longer allow writes to devices that
    are read-only.
