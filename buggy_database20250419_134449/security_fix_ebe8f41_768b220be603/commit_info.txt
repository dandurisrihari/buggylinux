Full commit message:
wifi: iwlwifi: implement GLAI ACPI table loading

All the regulatory tables from BIOS are going to be loaded
(preferably) from the UEFI instead of the ACPI.
There is a security issue with the fact that anyone can
add these UEFI variables.
The solution for that is to have a lock for all WIFI GUID UEFI
variables, and only if the UEFI variables are locked then we can
read it.
The status of the lock (unlocked, locked, test mode) is indicated
in a ACPI table: Guid Lock ACPI Indicator.
Load this table so the driver knows whether to read from UEFI or
not
