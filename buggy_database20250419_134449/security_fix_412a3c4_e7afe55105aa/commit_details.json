This starts providing guest support\nfor XSAVES (with no support yet for supervisor states, i.e. XSS == 0\nalways in guests for now).\n\nWanpeng Li suggested testing XSAVEC as well as XSAVES, since in practice\nno real processor exists that only has one of them, and there is no\nother way for userspace programs to compute the area of the XSAVEC\nsave area.
