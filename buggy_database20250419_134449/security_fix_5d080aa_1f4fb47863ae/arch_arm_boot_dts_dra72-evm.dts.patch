    ARM: dts: dra72: Add separate dtsi for tps65917
    
    dra72-evm-common.dtsi consolidates dra72-evm.dts and dra72-evm-revc.dts
    which also include tps65917 pmic support as both the evms uses the same
    pmic. But, dra71-evm has mostly similar features with a different pmic.
    In order to exploit dra72-evm-common.dtsi, creating a separate dtsi
    for tps65915 support and including it in respective board files.
