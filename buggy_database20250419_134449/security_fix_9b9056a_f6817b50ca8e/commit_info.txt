Full commit message:
firmware: tegra: bpmp: Replace deprecated strncpy() with strscpy_pad()

`strncpy` is deprecated for use on NUL-terminated destination strings [1].

We should prefer more robust and less ambiguous string interfaces.

It seems like the filename stored at `namevirt` is expected to be
NUL-terminated.

A suitable replacement is `strscpy_pad` due to the fact that it
guarantees NUL-termination on the destination buffer whilst maintaining
the NUL-padding behavior that strncpy provides.
