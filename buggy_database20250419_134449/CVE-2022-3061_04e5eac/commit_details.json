  "body": "The userspace program could pass any values to the driver through\nioctl() interface. If the driver doesn't check the value of pixclock,\nit may cause divide-by-zero error.\n\nAlthough pixclock is checked in savagefb_decode_var(), but it is not\nchecked properly in savagefb_probe(). Fix this by checking whether\npixclock is zero in the function savagefb_check_var() before\ninfo->var.pixclock is used as the divisor.\n\nThis is similar to CVE-2022-3061 in i740fb which was fixed by\ncommit 15cf0b8.\n\nSigned-off-by: Fullway Wang <fullwaywang@outlook.com>\nSigned-off-by: Helge Deller <deller@gmx.de>",
