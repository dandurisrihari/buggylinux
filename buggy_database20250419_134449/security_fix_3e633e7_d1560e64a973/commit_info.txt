Full commit message:
KVM: x86: Add interrupt injection information to the kvm_entry tracepoint

Add VMX/SVM specific interrupt injection info the kvm_entry tracepoint.
As is done with kvm_exit, gather the information via a kvm_x86_ops hook
to avoid the moderately costly VMREADs on VMX when the tracepoint isn't
enabled.

Opportunistically rename the parameters in the get_exit_info()
declaration to match the names used by both SVM and VMX.
