    EDAC/{skx_common,i10nm}: Fix some missing error reports on Emerald Rapids
    
    When doing error injection to some memory DIMMs on certain Intel Emerald
    Rapids servers, the i10nm_edac missed error reports for some memory DIMMs.
    
    Certain BIOS configurations may hide some memory controllers, and the
    i10nm_edac doesn't enumerate these hidden memory controllers. However, the
    ADXL decodes memory errors using memory controller physical indices even
    if there are hidden memory controllers. Therefore, the memory controller
    physical indices reported by the ADXL may mismatch the logical indices
    enumerated by the i10nm_edac, resulting in missed error reports for some
    memory DIMMs.
    
    Fix this issue by creating a mapping table from memory controller physical
    indices (used by the ADXL) to logical indices (used by the i10nm_edac) and
    using it to convert the physical indices to the logical indices during the
    error handling process.
