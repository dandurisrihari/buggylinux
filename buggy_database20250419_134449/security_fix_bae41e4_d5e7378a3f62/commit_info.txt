Merge tag 'sound-3.19-rc1' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tiwai/sound

Pull sound updates from Takashi Iwai:
 "This became a fairly large pull request.  In addition to the usual
  driver updates / fixes, there have been a high amount of cleanups in
  ASoC area, as well as control API helpers and kernel documentations
  fixes touching through the whole tree.

  In the driver side, the biggest changes are the support for new Intel
  SoC found on new x86 machines, and the updates of FireWire dice and
  oxfw drivers.

  Some remarkable items are below:

  ALSA core:
   - PCM mmap code cleanup, removal of arch-dependent codes
   - PCM xrun injection support
   - PCM hwptr tracepoint support
   - Refactoring of snd_pcm_action(), simplification of PCM locking
   - Robustified sequecner auto-load functionality
   - New control API helpers and lots of cleanups along with them
   - Lots of kerneldoc fixes and cleanups

  USB-audio:
   - The mixer resume code was largely rewritten, and the devices with
     quirks are resumed properly.
   - New hardware support: Focusrite Scarlett, Digidesign Mbox1,
     Denon/Marantz DACs, Zoom R16/24

  FireWire:
   - DICE driver updates with better duplex and sync support, including
     MIDI support
   - New OXFW driver for Oxford Semiconductor FW970/971 chipset,
     including the previous LaCie Speakers device.  Fullduplex and MIDI
     support included as well as DICE driver.

  HD-audio:
   - Refactoring the driver-caps quirk handling in snd-hda-intel
   - More consistent control names representing the topology better
   - Fixups: HP mute LED with ALC268 codec, Ideapad S210 built-in mic
     fix, ASUS Z99He laptop EAPD

  ASoC:
   - Conversion of AC'97 drivers to use regmap, bringing us closer to
     the removal of the ASoC level I/O code
   - Clean up a lot of old drivers that were open coding things that
     have subsequently been implemented in the core
   - Some DAPM performance improvements
   - Removal of the now seldom used CODEC mutex
   - Lots of updates for the newer Intel SoC support, including support
     for the DSP and some Cherrytrail and Braswell machine drivers
   - Support for Samsung boards using rt5631 as the CODEC
   - Removal of the obsolete AFEB9260 machine driver
   - Driver support for the TI TS3A227E headset driver used in some
     Chrombeooks

  Others:
   - ASIHPI driver update and cleanups
   - Lots of dev_*() printk conversions
   - Lots of trivial cleanups for the codes spotted by Coccinelle"
