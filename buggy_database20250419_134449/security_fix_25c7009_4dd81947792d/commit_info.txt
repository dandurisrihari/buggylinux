Full commit message:
bcachefs: Delete weird hacky transaction restart injection

since we currently don't have a good fault injection library,
bch2_btree_insert_node() was randomly injecting faults based on
local_clock().

At the very least this should have been a debug mode only thing, but
this is a brittle method so let's just delete it.
