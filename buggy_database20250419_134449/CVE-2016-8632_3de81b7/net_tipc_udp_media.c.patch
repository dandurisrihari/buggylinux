    tipc: check minimum bearer MTU
    
    Qian Zhang (张谦) reported a potential socket buffer overflow in
    tipc_msg_build() which is also known as CVE-2016-8632: due to
    insufficient checks, a buffer overflow can occur if MTU is too short for
    even tipc headers. As anyone can set device MTU in a user/net namespace,
    this issue can be abused by a regular user.
    
    As agreed in the discussion on Ben Hutchings' original patch, we should
    check the MTU at the moment a bearer is attached rather than for each
    processed packet. We also need to repeat the check when bearer MTU is
    adjusted to new device MTU. UDP case also needs a check to avoid
    overflow when calculating bearer MTU.
