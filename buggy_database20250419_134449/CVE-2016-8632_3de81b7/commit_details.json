As anyone can set device MTU in a user/net namespace,\nthis issue can be abused by a regular user.\n\nAs agreed in the discussion on Ben Hutchings' original patch, we should\ncheck the MTU at the moment a bearer is attached rather than for each\nprocessed packet. We also need to repeat the check when bearer MTU is\nadjusted to new device MTU. UDP case also needs a check to avoid\noverflow when calculating bearer MTU.\n\nFixes: b97bf3fd8f6a (\"[TIPC] Initial merge\")\nSigned-off-by: Michal Kubecek <mkubecek@suse.cz>\nReported-by: Qian Zhang (\u5f20\u8c26) <zhangqian-c@360.cn>\nAcked-by: Ying Xue <ying.xue@windriver.com>\nSigned-off-by: David S.
