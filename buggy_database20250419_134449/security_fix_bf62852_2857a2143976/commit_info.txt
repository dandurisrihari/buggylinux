[IA64] Itanium MC Error Injection Tool: Doc and sample application

This patch contains a documention and sample application. Since the sample
application has ~1000 lines of code, it might not be suitable in a kernel
documention in kenrel tree. If you think this is not good place to hold
the sample application, please let me know and I'm open to other choices
e.g. sourceforge etc.
