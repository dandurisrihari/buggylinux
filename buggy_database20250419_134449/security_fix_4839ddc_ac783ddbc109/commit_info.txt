Full commit message:
KVM: arm/arm64: vgic: Avoid injecting reserved IRQ numbers

Commit fd1d0ddf2ae9 (KVM: arm/arm64: check IRQ number on userland
injection) rightly limited the range of interrupts userspace can
inject in a guest, but failed to consider the (unlikely) case where
a guest is configured with 1024 interrupts.

In this case, interrupts ranging from 1020 to 1023 are unuseable,
as they have a special meaning for the GIC CPU interface.

Make sure that these number cannot be used as an IRQ. Also delete
a redundant (and similarily buggy) check in kvm_set_irq.
