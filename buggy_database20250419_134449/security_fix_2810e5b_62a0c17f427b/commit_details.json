  "subject": "xen-netback: coalesce slots in TX path and fix regressions",
  "body": "This patch tries to coalesce tx requests when constructing grant copy\nstructures. It enables netback to deal with situation when frontend's\nMAX_SKB_FRAGS is larger than backend's MAX_SKB_FRAGS.\n\nWith the help of coalescing, this patch tries to address two regressions\navoid reopening the security hole in XSA-39.\n\nRegression 1. The reduction of the number of supported ring entries (slots)\nper packet (from 18 to 17). This regression has been around for some time but\nremains unnoticed until XSA-39 security fix. This is fixed by coalescing\nslots.\n\nRegression 2. The XSA-39 security fix turning \"too many frags\" errors from\njust dropping the packet to a fatal error and disabling the VIF. This is fixed\nby coalescing slots (handling 18 slots when backend's MAX_SKB_FRAGS is 17)\nwhich rules out false positive (using 18 slots is legit) and dropping packets\nusing 19 to `max_skb_slots` slots.\n\nTo avoid reopening security hole in XSA-39, frontend sending packet using more\nthan max_skb_slots is considered malicious.\n\nThe behavior of netback for packet is thus:\n\n    1-18            slots: valid\n   19-max_skb_slots slots: drop and respond with an error\n   max_skb_slots+   slots: fatal error\n\nmax_skb_slots is configurable by admin, default value is 20.\n\nAlso change variable name from \"frags\" to \"slots\" in netbk_count_requests.\n\nPlease note that RX path still has dependency on MAX_SKB_FRAGS. This will be\nfixed with separate patch.\n\nSigned-off-by: Wei Liu <wei.liu2@citrix.com>\nAcked-by: Ian Campbell <ian.campbell@citrix.com>\nSigned-off-by: David S. Miller <davem@davemloft.net>",
