    Pull more arm64 updates from Catalin Marinas:
     "As I mentioned in the last pull request, there's a second batch of
      security updates for arm64 with mitigations for Spectre/v1 and an
      improved one for Spectre/v2 (via a newly defined firmware interface
      API).
    
      Spectre v1 mitigation:
    
       - back-end version of array_index_mask_nospec()
    
       - masking of the syscall number to restrict speculation through the
         syscall table
    
       - masking of __user pointers prior to deference in uaccess routines
    
      Spectre v2 mitigation update:
    
       - using the new firmware SMC calling convention specification update
    
       - removing the current PSCI GET_VERSION firmware call mitigation as
         vendors are deploying new SMCCC-capable firmware
    
       - additional branch predictor hardening for synchronous exceptions
         and interrupts while in user mode
    
      Meltdown v3 mitigation update:
    
        - Cavium Thunder X is unaffected but a hardware erratum gets in the
          way. The kernel now starts with the page tables mapped as global
          and switches to non-global if kpti needs to be enabled.
    
      Other:
    
       - Theoretical trylock bug fixed"
