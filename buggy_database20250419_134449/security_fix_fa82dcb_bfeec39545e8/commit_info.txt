Merge tag 'dax-fixes-4.20-rc6' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/nvdimm/nvdimm

Pull dax fixes from Dan Williams:
 "The last of the known regression fixes and fallout from the Xarray
  conversion of the filesystem-dax implementation.

  On the path to debugging why the dax memory-failure injection test
  started failing after the Xarray conversion a couple more fixes for
  the dax_lock_mapping_entry(), now called dax_lock_page(), surfaced.
  Those plus the bug that started the hunt are now addressed. These
  patches have appeared in a -next release with no issues reported.

  Note the touches to mm/memory-failure.c are just the conversion to the
  new function signature for dax_lock_page().

  Summary:

   - Fix the Xarray conversion of fsdax to properly handle
     dax_lock_mapping_entry() in the presense of pmd entries

   - Fix inode destruction racing a new lock request"
