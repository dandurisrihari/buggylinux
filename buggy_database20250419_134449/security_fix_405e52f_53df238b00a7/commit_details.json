  "body": "There are already 3 versions of the Up boards with support for the SOF\ncommunity key (ApolloLake, WhiskyLake, TigerLake). Rather than\ncontinue to add quirks for each version, let's add a wildcard.\n\nFor WHL and TGL, the authentication supports both the SOF community\nkey and the firmware signed with the Intel production key. Given two\nchoices, the community key is the preferred option to allow developers\nto sign their own firmware. The firmware signed with production key\ncan still be selected if needed with a kernel module\noption (snd-sof-pci.fw_path=\"intel/sof\")\n\nTested-by: P\u00e9ter Ujfalusi <peter.ujfalusi@linux.intel.com>\nSigned-off-by: Pierre-Louis Bossart <pierre-louis.bossart@linux.intel.com>\nReviewed-by: Bard Liao <yung-chuan.liao@linux.intel.com>\nReviewed-by: P\u00e9ter Ujfalusi <peter.ujfalusi@linux.intel.com>\nLink: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20211119231327.211946-1-pierre-louis.bossart@linux.intel.com\nSigned-off-by: Mark Brown <broonie@kernel.org>",
