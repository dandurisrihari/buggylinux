    arm64: expose user PAC bit positions via ptrace
    
    When pointer authentication is in use, data/instruction pointers have a
    number of PAC bits inserted into them. The number and position of these
    bits depends on the configured TCR_ELx.TxSZ and whether tagging is
    enabled. ARMv8.3 allows tagging to differ for instruction and data
    pointers.
    
    For userspace debuggers to unwind the stack and/or to follow pointer
    chains, they need to be able to remove the PAC bits before attempting to
    use a pointer.
    
    This patch adds a new structure with masks describing the location of
    the PAC bits in userspace instruction and data pointers (i.e. those
    addressable via TTBR0), which userspace can query via PTRACE_GETREGSET.
    By clearing these bits from pointers (and replacing them with the value
    of bit 55), userspace can acquire the PAC-less versions.
    
    This new regset is exposed when the kernel is built with (user) pointer
    authentication support, and the address authentication feature is
    enabled. Otherwise, the regset is hidden.
