Full commit message:
hwmon: (nct6775) Fix potential Spectre v1

val can be indirectly controlled by user-space, hence leading to
a potential exploitation of the Spectre variant 1 vulnerability.

This issue was detected with the help of Smatch:

vers/hwmon/nct6775.c:2698 store_pwm_weight_temp_sel() warn: potential
spectre issue 'data->temp_src' [r]

Fix this by sanitizing val before using it to index data->temp_src

Notice that given that speculation windows are large, the policy is
to kill the speculation on the first load and not worry if it can be
completed with a dependent load/store [1].
