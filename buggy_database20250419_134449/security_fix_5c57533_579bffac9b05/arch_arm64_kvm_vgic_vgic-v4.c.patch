    KVM: arm64: vgic-v4: Fall back to software irqbypass if LPI not found
    
    Continuing with the theme of broken VMMs and guests, irqbypass
    registration can fail if the virtual ITS lacks a translation for the
    MSI. Either the guest hasn't mapped it or userspace may have forgotten
    to restore the ITS.
    
    Exit silently and allow irqbypass configuration to succeed. As a reward
    for ingenuity, LPIs are demoted to software injection.
