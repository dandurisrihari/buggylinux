Full commit message:
sched,acpi_pad: Convert to sched_set_fifo*()

Because SCHED_FIFO is a broken scheduler model (see previous patches)
take away the priority field, the kernel can't possibly make an
informed decision.

In this case, use fifo_low, because it only cares about being above
SCHED_NORMAL. Effectively no change in behaviour.

XXX: this driver is still complete crap; why isn't it using proper
idle injection or at the very least play_idle() ?
