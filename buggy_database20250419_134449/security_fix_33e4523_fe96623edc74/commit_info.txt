Full commit message:
arm64: initialize and switch ptrauth kernel keys

Set up keys to use pointer authentication within the kernel. The kernel
will be compiled with APIAKey instructions, the other keys are currently
unused. Each task is given its own APIAKey, which is initialized during
fork. The key is changed during context switch and on kernel entry from
EL0.

The keys for idle threads need to be set before calling any C functions,
because it is not possible to enter and exit a function with different
keys.
