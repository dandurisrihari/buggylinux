    arm64: initialize and switch ptrauth kernel keys
    
    Set up keys to use pointer authentication within the kernel. The kernel
    will be compiled with APIAKey instructions, the other keys are currently
    unused. Each task is given its own APIAKey, which is initialized during
    fork. The key is changed during context switch and on kernel entry from
    EL0.
    
    The keys for idle threads need to be set before calling any C functions,
    because it is not possible to enter and exit a function with different
    keys.
