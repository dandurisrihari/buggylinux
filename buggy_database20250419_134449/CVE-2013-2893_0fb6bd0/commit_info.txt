Subject: HID: LG: validate HID output report details

CVE Identifiers:
- CVE-2013-2893

Full commit message:
HID: LG: validate HID output report details

A HID device could send a malicious output report that would cause the
lg, lg3, and lg4 HID drivers to write beyond the output report allocation
during an event, causing a heap overflow:

[  325.245240] usb 1-1: New USB device found, idVendor=046d, idProduct=c287
...
[  414.518960] BUG kmalloc-4096 (Not tainted): Redzone overwritten

Additionally, while lg2 did correctly validate the report details, it was
cleaned up and shortened.
