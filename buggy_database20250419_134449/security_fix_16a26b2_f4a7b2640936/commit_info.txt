Full commit message:
ubifs: authentication: Add hashes to index nodes

With this patch the hashes over the index nodes stored in the tree node
cache are written to flash and are checked when read back from flash.
The hash of the root index node is stored in the master node.

During journal replay the hashes are regenerated from the read nodes
and stored in the tree node cache. This means the nodes must previously
be authenticated by other means. This is done in a later patch.
