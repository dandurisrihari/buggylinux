Full commit message:
KVM: arm64: Refine _EL2 system register list that require trap reinjection

Implement a fine grained approach in the _EL2 sysreg range instead of
the current wide cast trap. This ensures that we don't mistakenly
inject the wrong exception into the guest.

[maz: commit message massaging, dropped secure and AArch32 registers
      from the list]
