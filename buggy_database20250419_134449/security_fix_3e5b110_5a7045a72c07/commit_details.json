  "body": "In order to handle association and authentication in AP mode,\nhostapd needs access to the tx status info of its own frames\nthrough a cooked monitor interface. Without this patch the\ncooked monitor interfaces also passed on tx status information\nfor packets from other virtual interfaces. This creates a\nsignificant performance issue on embedded system. Hostapd\ntries to work around this by installing a Linux Socket Filter\nthat only captures the frames it's interested in, however\ndata duplication and socket filter matching still uses up\nenough CPU cycles to be very noticeable on small systems.\nThis patch ensures that tx status information of non-injected\nframes does not make it to cooked monitor interfaces.\n\nSigned-off-by: Felix Fietkau <nbd@openwrt.org>\nSigned-off-by: John W.
