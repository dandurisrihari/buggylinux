    ====================
    Some updates:
     * injection/radiotap updates for new test capabilities
     * remove WDS support - even years ago when we turned
       it off by default it was already basically unusable
     * support for HE (802.11ax) rates for beacons
     * support for some vendor-specific HE rates
     * many other small features/cleanups
