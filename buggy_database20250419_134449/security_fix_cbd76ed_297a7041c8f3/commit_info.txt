Merge tag 'pull-18-rc1-work.mount' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/viro/vfs

Pull mount handling updates from Al Viro:
 "Cleanups (and one fix) around struct mount handling.

  The fix is usermode_driver.c one - once you've done kern_mount(), you
  must kern_unmount(); simple mntput() will end up with a leak. Several
  failure exits in there messed up that way... In practice you won't hit
  those particular failure exits without fault injection, though"

* tag 'pull-18-rc1-work.mount' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/viro/vfs:
  move mount-related externs from fs.h to mount.h
  blob_to_mnt(): kern_unmount() is needed to undo kern_mount()
  m->mnt_root->d_inode->i_sb is a weird way to spell m->mnt_sb...
  linux/mount.h: trim includes
  uninline may_mount() and don't opencode it in fspick(2)/fsopen(2)
