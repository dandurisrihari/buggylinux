    Pull mount handling updates from Al Viro:
     "Cleanups (and one fix) around struct mount handling.
    
      The fix is usermode_driver.c one - once you've done kern_mount(), you
      must kern_unmount(); simple mntput() will end up with a leak. Several
      failure exits in there messed up that way... In practice you won't hit
      those particular failure exits without fault injection, though"
    
    * tag 'pull-18-rc1-work.mount' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/viro/vfs:
      move mount-related externs from fs.h to mount.h
      blob_to_mnt(): kern_unmount() is needed to undo kern_mount()
      m->mnt_root->d_inode->i_sb is a weird way to spell m->mnt_sb...
      linux/mount.h: trim includes
      uninline may_mount() and don't opencode it in fspick(2)/fsopen(2)
