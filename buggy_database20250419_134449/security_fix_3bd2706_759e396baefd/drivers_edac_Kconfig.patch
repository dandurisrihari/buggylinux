    EDAC/zynqmp: Add EDAC support for Xilinx ZynqMP OCM
    
    Add EDAC support for Xilinx ZynqMP OCM Controller, so this driver reports CE and
    UE errors upon interrupt generation. Also add debugfs files for error injection.
    
    On Xilinx ZynqMP platform, both OCM Controller driver(zynqmp_edac) and DDR
    Memory Controller driver(synopsys_edac) co-exist which means both can be loaded
    at a time. This scenario is tested on Xilinx ZynqMP platform.
    
    Fix following issue reported by the robot:
      "MAINTAINERS references a file that doesn't exist:
      Documentation/devicetree/bindings/edac/xlnx,zynqmp-ocmc.yaml"
