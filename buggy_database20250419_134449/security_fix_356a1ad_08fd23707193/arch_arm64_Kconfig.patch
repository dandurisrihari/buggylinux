    Merge tag 'arm64-upstream' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/arm64/linux
    
    Pull arm64 updates from Will Deacon:
    
     - Support for including MTE tags in ELF coredumps
    
     - Instruction encoder updates, including fixes to 64-bit immediate
       generation and support for the LSE atomic instructions
    
     - Improvements to kselftests for MTE and fpsimd
    
     - Symbol aliasing and linker script cleanups
    
     - Reduce instruction cache maintenance performed for user mappings
       created using contiguous PTEs
    
     - Support for the new "asymmetric" MTE mode, where stores are checked
       asynchronously but loads are checked synchronously
    
     - Support for the latest pointer authentication algorithm ("QARMA3")
    
     - Support for the DDR PMU present in the Marvell CN10K platform
    
     - Support for the CPU PMU present in the Apple M1 platform
    
     - Use the RNDR instruction for arch_get_random_{int,long}()
    
     - Update our copy of the Arm optimised string routines for str{n}cmp()
    
     - Fix signal frame generation for CPUs which have foolishly elected to
       avoid building in support for the fpsimd instructions
    
     - Workaround for Marvell GICv3 erratum #38545
    
     - Clarification to our Documentation (booting reqs. and MTE prctl())
    
     - Miscellanous cleanups and minor fixes
