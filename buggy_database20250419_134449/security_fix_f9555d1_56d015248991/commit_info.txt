Full commit message:
crypto: qat - set parity error mask for qat_420xx

The field parerr_wat_wcp_mask in the structure adf_dev_err_mask enables
the detection and reporting of parity errors for the wireless cipher and
wireless authentication accelerators.

Set the parerr_wat_wcp_mask field, which was inadvertently omitted
during the initial enablement of the qat_420xx driver, to ensure that
parity errors are enabled for those accelerators.

In addition, fix the string used to report such errors that was
inadvertently set to "ath_cph" (authentication and cipher).
