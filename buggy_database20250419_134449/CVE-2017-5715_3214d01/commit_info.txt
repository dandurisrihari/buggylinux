Full commit message:
KVM: PPC: Book3S: Provide information about hardware/firmware CVE workarounds

This adds a new ioctl, KVM_PPC_GET_CPU_CHAR, that gives userspace
information about the underlying machine's level of vulnerability
to the recently announced vulnerabilities CVE-2017-5715,
CVE-2017-5753 and CVE-2017-5754, and whether the machine provides
instructions to assist software to work around the vulnerabilities.

The ioctl returns two u64 words describing characteristics of the
CPU and required software behaviour respectively, plus two mask
words which indicate which bits have been filled in by the kernel,
for extensibility.  The bit definitions are the same as for the
new H_GET_CPU_CHARACTERISTICS hypercall.

There is also a new capability, KVM_CAP_PPC_GET_CPU_CHAR, which
indicates whether the new ioctl is available.
