Full commit message:
drm/i915/hdcp: Fix Repeater authentication during topology change

When topology changes, before beginning a new HDCP authentication by
sending AKE_init message we need to first authenticate only the
repeater. Only after repeater authentication failure, it makes sense
to start a new HDCP authentication. Even though it made sense to not
enable HDCP directly from check_link and schedule it for later, repeater
authentication needs to be done immediately.
