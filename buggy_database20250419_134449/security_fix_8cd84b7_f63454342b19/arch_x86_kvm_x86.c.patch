     "PPC:
       - Improvements and bugfixes for secure VM support, giving reduced
         startup time and memory hotplug support.
    
       - Locking fixes in nested KVM code
    
       - Increase number of guests supported by HV KVM to 4094
    
       - Preliminary POWER10 support
    
      ARM:
       - Split the VHE and nVHE hypervisor code bases, build the EL2 code
         separately, allowing for the VHE code to now be built with
         instrumentation
    
       - Level-based TLB invalidation support
    
       - Restructure of the vcpu register storage to accomodate the NV code
    
       - Pointer Authentication available for guests on nVHE hosts
    
       - Simplification of the system register table parsing
    
       - MMU cleanups and fixes
    
       - A number of post-32bit cleanups and other fixes
    
      MIPS:
       - compilation fixes
    
      x86:
       - bugfixes
    
       - support for the SERIALIZE instruction"
