Full commit message:
KVM: x86: Handle kernel- and KVM-defined CPUID words in a single helper

Merge kvm_cpu_cap_init() and kvm_cpu_cap_init_kvm_defined() into a single
helper.  The only advantage of separating the two was to make it somewhat
obvious that KVM directly initializes the KVM-defined words, whereas using
a common helper will allow for hardening both kernel- and KVM-defined
CPUID words without needing copy+paste.

No functional change intended.
