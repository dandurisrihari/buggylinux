s390/sclp: replace deprecated strncpy with strtomem

Let's move away from using strncpy() as it is deprecated [1].

Instead use strtomem() as `e.id` is already marked as nonstring:
|       char id[4] __nonstring;

We don't need strtomem_pad() because `e` is already memset to 0 --
rendering any additional NUL-padding useless.
