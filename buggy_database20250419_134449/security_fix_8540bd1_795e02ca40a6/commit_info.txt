  : From the cover letter:
  :
  : "This series is a bit of a bombay-mix of patches we've been
  : carrying. There's no one overarching theme, but they do improve
  : the code by fixing existing bugs in pKVM, refactoring code to
  : make it more readable and easier to re-use for pKVM, or adding
  : functionality to the existing pKVM code upstream."
