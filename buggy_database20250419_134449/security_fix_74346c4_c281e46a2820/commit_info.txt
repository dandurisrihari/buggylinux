====================
wireless-drivers fixes for 5.3

Fourth set of fixes for 5.3, and hopefully really the last one. Quite
a few CVE fixes this time but at least to my knowledge none of them
have a known exploit.

mt76

* workaround firmware hang by disabling hardware encryption on MT7630E

* disable 5GHz band for MT7630E as it's not working properly

mwifiex

* fix IE parsing to avoid a heap buffer overflow

iwlwifi

* fix for QuZ device initialisation

rt2x00

* another fix for rekeying

* revert a commit causing degradation in rx signal levels

rsi

* fix a double free
