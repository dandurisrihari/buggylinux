Full commit message:
bcachefs: Fix safe errors by default

i.e. the start of automatic self healing:

If errors=continue or fix_safe, we now automatically fix simple errors
without user intervention.

New error action option: fix_safe

This replaces the existing errors=ro option, which gets a new slot, i.e.
existing errors=ro users now get errors=fix_safe.

This is currently only enabled for a limited set of errors - initially
just disk accounting; errors we would never not want to fix, and we
don't want to require user intervention (i.e. to make sure a bug report
gets filed).

Errors will still be counted in the superblock, so we (developers) will
still know they've been occuring if a bug report gets filed (as bug
reports typically include the errors superblock section).

Eventually we'll be enabling this for a much wider set of errors, after
we've done thorough error injection testing.
