Merge branch 'for-next' of git://git.samba.org/sfrench/cifs-2.6

Pull CIFS fixes from Steve French:
 "This includes a set of misc.  cifs fixes (most importantly some byte
  range lock related write fixes from Pavel, and some ACL and idmap
  related fixes from Jeff) but also includes the SMB2.02 dialect
  enablement, and a key fix for SMB3 mounts.

  Default authentication upgraded to ntlmv2 for cifs (it was already
  ntlmv2 for smb2)"
