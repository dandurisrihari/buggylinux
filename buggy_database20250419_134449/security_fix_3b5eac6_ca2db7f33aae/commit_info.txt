Full commit message:
usb: gadget: mv_u3d: replace deprecated strncpy with strscpy

strncpy() is deprecated for use on NUL-terminated destination strings
[1] and as such we should prefer more robust and less ambiguous string
interfaces.

Let's opt for the new 2-argument version of strscpy() which guarantees
NUL-termination on the destination buffer and simplifies snytax. The
NUL-padding behavior that strncpy() provides is not required as u3d->eps
is already zero-allocated:
|	u3d->eps = kzalloc(size, GFP_KERNEL);
