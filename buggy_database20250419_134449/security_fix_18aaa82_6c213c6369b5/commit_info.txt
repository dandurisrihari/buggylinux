Full commit message:
net: netlink: Remove the dump_cb_mutex field from struct netlink_sock

Commit 5fbf57a937f4 ("net: netlink: remove the cb_mutex "injection" from
netlink core") has removed the usage of the 'dump_cb_mutex' field from the
struct netlink_sock.

Remove the field itself now. It saves a few bytes in the structure.
