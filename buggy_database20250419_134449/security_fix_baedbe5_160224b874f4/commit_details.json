  "body": "Commit 8626c56c8279 (\"bridge: fix potential use-after-free when hook\nreturns QUEUE or STOLEN verdict\") caused LLDP packets arriving through a\nbridge port to be re-injected to the Rx path with skb->dev set to the\nbridge device, but this breaks the lldpad daemon.\n\nThe lldpad daemon opens a packet socket with protocol set to ETH_P_LLDP\nfor any valid device on the system, which doesn't not include soft\ndevices such as bridge and VLAN.\n\nSince packet sockets (ptype_base) are processed in the Rx path after the\nRx handler, LLDP packets with skb->dev set to the bridge device never\nreach the lldpad daemon.\n\nFix this by making the bridge's Rx handler re-inject LLDP packets with\nRX_HANDLER_PASS, which effectively restores the behaviour prior to the\nmentioned commit.\n\nThis means netfilter will never receive LLDP packets coming through a\nbridge port, as I don't see a way in which we can have okfn() consume\nthe packet without breaking existing behaviour.
