Full commit message:
mac80211: generalise work handling

In order to use auth/assoc for different purposes
other than MLME, it needs to be split up. For other
purposes, a generic work handling (potentially on
another channel) will be useful.

To achieve that, this patch moves much of the MLME
work handling out of mlme into a new work API. The
API can currently handle probing a specific AP,
authentication and association. The MLME previously
handled probe/authentication as one step and will
continue to do so, but they are separate in the new
work handling.

Work items are RCU-managed to be able to check for
existence of an item for a specific frame in the RX
path, but they can be re-used which the MLME right
now will do for its combined probe/auth step.
