       - Allow NULL to be passed in to ->direct_access() for kaddr and pfn
         params.
    
       - Improve smart injection support for nvdimm emulation testing.
    
       - Fix test code that supports for emulating controller temperature.
    
       - Fix hang on error before devm_memremap_pages()
    
       - Fix a bug that causes user memory corruption when data returned to
         user for ars_status.
