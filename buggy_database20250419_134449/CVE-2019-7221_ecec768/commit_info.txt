Full commit message:
KVM: nVMX: unconditionally cancel preemption timer in free_nested (CVE-2019-7221)

Bugzilla: 1671904

There are multiple code paths where an hrtimer may have been started to
emulate an L1 VMX preemption timer that can result in a call to free_nested
without an intervening L2 exit where the hrtimer is normally
cancelled. Unconditionally cancel in free_nested to cover all cases.

Embargoed until Feb 7th 2019.
