  "body": "OSS PCM stream management isn't modal but it allows ioctls issued at\nany time for changing the parameters.  In the previous hardening\npatch (\"ALSA: pcm: Avoid potential races between OSS ioctls and\nread/write\"), we covered these races and prevent the corruption by\nprotecting the concurrent accesses via params_lock mutex.  However,\nthis means that some ioctls that try to change the stream parameter\n(e.g. channels or format) would be blocked until the read/write\nfinishes, and it may take really long.\n\nBasically changing the parameter while reading/writing is an invalid\noperation, hence it's even more user-friendly from the API POV if it\nreturns -EBUSY in such a situation.\n\nThis patch adds such checks in the relevant ioctls with the addition\nof read/write access refcount.\n\nCc: <stable@vger.kernel.org>\nSigned-off-by: Takashi Iwai <tiwai@suse.de>",
