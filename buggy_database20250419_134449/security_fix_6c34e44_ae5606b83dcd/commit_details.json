But for ccm\nalgorithms, the mac is part of the output stream and not retrieved\nfrom the IV registers, thus needing a separate buffer to retrieve it.\nMake enabling RESULTS_DUMP field optional so that algorithms can choose\nwhether or not to enable the option.\nNote that in this patch, the enabled algorithms always choose\nRESULTS_DUMP to be enabled.
