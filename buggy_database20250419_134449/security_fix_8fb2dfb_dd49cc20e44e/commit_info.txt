Full commit message:
stackleak: Register the 'stackleak_cleanup' pass before the '*free_cfg' pass

Currently the 'stackleak_cleanup' pass deleting a CALL insn is executed
after the 'reload' pass. That allows gcc to do some weird optimization in
function prologues and epilogues, which are generated later [1].

Let's avoid that by registering the 'stackleak_cleanup' pass before
the '*free_cfg' pass. It's the moment when the stack frame size is
already final, function prologues and epilogues are generated, and the
machine-dependent code transformations are not done.
