    x86/bhi: Add BHI mitigation knob
    
    Branch history clearing software sequences and hardware control
    BHI_DIS_S were defined to mitigate Branch History Injection (BHI).
    
    Add cmdline spectre_bhi={on|off|auto} to control BHI mitigation:
    
     auto - Deploy the hardware mitigation BHI_DIS_S, if available.
     on   - Deploy the hardware mitigation BHI_DIS_S, if available,
            otherwise deploy the software sequence at syscall entry and
            VMexit.
     off  - Turn off BHI mitigation.
    
    The default is auto mode which does not deploy the software sequence
    mitigation.  This is because of the hardening done in the syscall
    dispatch path, which is the likely target of BHI.
