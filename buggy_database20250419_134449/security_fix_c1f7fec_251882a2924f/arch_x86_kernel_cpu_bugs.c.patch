    x86/speculation: Allow guests to use SSBD even if host does not
    
    The bits set in x86_spec_ctrl_mask are used to calculate the guest's value
    of SPEC_CTRL that is written to the MSR before VMENTRY, and control which
    mitigations the guest can enable.  In the case of SSBD, unless the host has
    enabled SSBD always on mode (by passing "spec_store_bypass_disable=on" in
    the kernel parameters), the SSBD bit is not set in the mask and the guest
    can not properly enable the SSBD always on mitigation mode.
    
    This has been confirmed by running the SSBD PoC on a guest using the SSBD
    always on mitigation mode (booted with kernel parameter
    "spec_store_bypass_disable=on"), and verifying that the guest is vulnerable
    unless the host is also using SSBD always on mode. In addition, the guest
    OS incorrectly reports the SSB vulnerability as mitigated.
    
    Always set the SSBD bit in x86_spec_ctrl_mask when the host CPU supports
    it, allowing the guest to use SSBD whether or not the host has chosen to
    enable the mitigation in any of its modes.
