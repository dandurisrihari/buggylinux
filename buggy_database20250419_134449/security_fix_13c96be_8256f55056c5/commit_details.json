  "body": "The address space in ADSP PAS (Peripheral Authentication Service)\nremoteproc node should point to the QDSP PUB address space\n(QDSP6...SS_PUB): 0x0300_0000 with length of 0x10000, which also matches\ndownstream DTS.  0x3000_0000, value used so far, was in datasheet is the\nregion of CDSP.\n\nCorrect the base address and length, which also moves the node to\ndifferent place to keep things sorted by unit address.  The diff looks\nbig, but only the unit address and \"reg\" property were changed.  This\nshould have no functional impact on Linux users, because PAS loader does\nnot use this address space at all.\n\nFixes: 1172729576fb (\"arm64: dts: qcom: sm8450: Add remoteproc enablers and instances\")\nCc: stable@vger.kernel.org\nReviewed-by: Neil Armstrong <neil.armstrong@linaro.org>\nSigned-off-by: Krzysztof Kozlowski <krzysztof.kozlowski@linaro.org>\nLink: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20241213-dts-qcom-cdsp-mpss-base-address-v3-4-2e0036fccd8d@linaro.org\nSigned-off-by: Bjorn Andersson <andersson@kernel.org>",
