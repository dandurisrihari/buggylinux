  "body": "Currently for the PCM and mixer tests we report test names which identify\nthe card being tested with the card number. This ensures we have unique\nnames but since card numbers are dynamically assigned at runtime the names\nwe end up with will often not be stable on systems with multiple cards\nespecially where those cards are provided by separate modules loeaded at\nruntime. This makes it difficult for automated systems and UIs to relate\ntest results between runs on affected platforms.\n\nAddress this by replacing our use of card numbers with card names which are\nmore likely to be stable across runs. We use the card ID since it is\nguaranteed to be unique by default, unlike the long name. There is still\nsome vulnerability to ordering issues if multiple cards with the same base\nID are present in the system but have separate dependencies but not all\ndrivers put distinguishing information in their long names.\n\nSigned-off-by: Mark Brown <broonie@kernel.org>\nLink: https://patch.msgid.link/20240716-alsa-kselftest-board-name-v2-1-60f1acdde096@kernel.org\nSigned-off-by: Takashi Iwai <tiwai@suse.de>",
