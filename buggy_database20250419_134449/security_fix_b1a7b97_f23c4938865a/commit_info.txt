Full commit message:
kselftest/alsa: Use card name rather than number in test names

Currently for the PCM and mixer tests we report test names which identify
the card being tested with the card number. This ensures we have unique
names but since card numbers are dynamically assigned at runtime the names
we end up with will often not be stable on systems with multiple cards
especially where those cards are provided by separate modules loeaded at
runtime. This makes it difficult for automated systems and UIs to relate
test results between runs on affected platforms.

Address this by replacing our use of card numbers with card names which are
more likely to be stable across runs. We use the card ID since it is
guaranteed to be unique by default, unlike the long name. There is still
some vulnerability to ordering issues if multiple cards with the same base
ID are present in the system but have separate dependencies but not all
drivers put distinguishing information in their long names.
