Full commit message:
auxdisplay: panel: Replace deprecated strncpy() with strtomem_pad()

`strncpy` is deprecated and as such we should prefer more robust and
less ambiguous interfaces.

In this case, all of `press_str`, `repeat_str` and `release_str` are
explicitly marked as nonstring:
|   struct {	/* valid when type == INPUT_TYPE_KBD */
|           char press_str[sizeof(void *) + sizeof(int)] __nonstring;
|           char repeat_str[sizeof(void *) + sizeof(int)] __nonstring;
|           char release_str[sizeof(void *) + sizeof(int)] __nonstring;
|   } kbd;

... which makes `strtomem_pad` a suitable replacement as it is
functionally the same whilst being more obvious about its behavior.
