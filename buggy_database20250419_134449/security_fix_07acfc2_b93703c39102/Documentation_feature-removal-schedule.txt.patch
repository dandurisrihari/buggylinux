commit 07acfc2a9349a8ce45b236c2624dad452001966b
Merge: b5f4035adfff 322728e55aa7
Author: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org>

    Merge branch 'next' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/virt/kvm/kvm
    
    Pull KVM changes from Avi Kivity:
     "Changes include additional instruction emulation, page-crossing MMIO,
      faster dirty logging, preventing the watchdog from killing a stopped
      guest, module autoload, a new MSI ABI, and some minor optimizations
      and fixes.  Outside x86 we have a small s390 and a very large ppc
      update.
    
      Regarding the new (for kvm) rebaseless workflow, some of the patches
      that were merged before we switch trees had to be rebased, while
      others are true pulls.  In either case the signoffs should be correct
      now."
    
    Fix up trivial conflicts in Documentation/feature-removal-schedule.txt
    arch/powerpc/kvm/book3s_segment.S and arch/x86/include/asm/kvm_para.h.
    
    I suspect the kvm_para.h resolution ends up doing the "do I have cpuid"
    check effectively twice (it was done differently in two different
    commits), but better safe than sorry ;)

@@@ -561,30 -542,8 +561,37 @@@ Who:	Sasikantha Babu <sasikanth.v19@gma
  
  ----------------------------
  
 +What:	remove bogus DV presets V4L2_DV_1080I29_97, V4L2_DV_1080I30 and
 +	V4L2_DV_1080I25
 +When:	3.6
 +Why:	These HDTV formats do not exist and were added by a confused mind
 +	(that was me, to be precise...)
 +Who:	Hans Verkuil <hans.verkuil@cisco.com>
 +
 +----------------------------
 +
 +What:	V4L2_CID_HCENTER, V4L2_CID_VCENTER V4L2 controls
 +When:	3.7
 +Why:	The V4L2_CID_VCENTER, V4L2_CID_HCENTER controls have been deprecated
 +	for about 4 years and they are not used by any mainline driver.
 +	There are newer controls (V4L2_CID_PAN*, V4L2_CID_TILT*) that provide
 +	similar	functionality.
 +Who:	Sylwester Nawrocki <sylvester.nawrocki@gmail.com>
 +
 +----------------------------
 +
 +What:	cgroup option updates via remount
 +When:	March 2013
 +Why:	Remount currently allows changing bound subsystems and
 +	release_agent.  Rebinding is hardly useful as it only works
 +	when the hierarchy is empty and release_agent itself should be
 +	replaced with conventional fsnotify.
 +
 +----------------------------
++
+ What:	KVM debugfs statistics
+ When:	2013
+ Why:	KVM tracepoints provide mostly equivalent information in a much more
+         flexible fashion.
