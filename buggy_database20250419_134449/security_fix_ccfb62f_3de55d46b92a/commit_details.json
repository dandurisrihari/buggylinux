Otherwise it\ncould result in a buffer overflow when we copy the name back to the user\nwith IMGETDEVINFO ioctl.\n\nI also changed two strcpy() calls which handle the name to strscpy().\nHopefully, there aren't any other ways to create a too long name, but\nit's nice to do this as a kernel hardening measure.\n\nSigned-off-by: Dan Carpenter <dan.carpenter@oracle.com>\nSigned-off-by: David S.
