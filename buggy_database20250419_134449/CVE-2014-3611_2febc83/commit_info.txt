Full commit message:
KVM: x86: Improve thread safety in pit

There's a race condition in the PIT emulation code in KVM.  In
__kvm_migrate_pit_timer the pit_timer object is accessed without
synchronization.  If the race condition occurs at the wrong time this
can crash the host kernel.

This fixes CVE-2014-3611.
