Full commit message:
microblaze: Add xmb_manager_register function

Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) Microblaze solution provides soft error
injection, detection, correction and recovery for Microblaze cores in the
system. The Xilinx/AMD Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) solution in Vivado
provides all the necessary building blocks to implement a redundant
triplicated MicroBlaze subsystem. This processing subsystem is
fault-tolerant and continues to operate nominally after encountering an
error. Together with the capability to detect and recover from errors,
the implementation ensures the reliability of the entire subsystem.

When the break vector gets asserted because of error injection,
the break signal must be blocked before exiting from the break handler,
This commit adds support for xmb_manager_register api which updates the
TMR manager address and control register and error count and reset callback
function arguments, which will be used by the break handler to block the
break and call the error count callback function and reset callback
function.
