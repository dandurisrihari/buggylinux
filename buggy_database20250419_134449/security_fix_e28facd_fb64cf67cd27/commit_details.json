Conversely,\nfor decryption, the caller must provide the first semiblock of the data\nas the IV and the following blocks as ciphertext.\n\nThe key wrapping is an authenticated decryption operation. The caller\nwill receive EBADMSG during decryption if the authentication failed.\n\nAlbeit the standards define the key wrapping for AES only, the template\ncan be used with any other block cipher that has a block size of 16\nbytes. During initialization of the template, that condition is checked.\nAny cipher not having a block size of 16 bytes will cause the\ninitialization to fail.\n\nSigned-off-by: Stephan Mueller <smueller@chronox.de>\nSigned-off-by: Herbert Xu <herbert@gondor.apana.org.au>",
