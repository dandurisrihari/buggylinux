    Pull networking updates from David Miller:
    
     1) New ipset extensions for matching on destination MAC addresses, from
        Stefano Brivio.
    
     2) Add ipv4 ttl and tos, plus ipv6 flow label and hop limit offloads to
        nfp driver. From Stefano Brivio.
    
     3) Implement GRO for plain UDP sockets, from Paolo Abeni.
    
     4) Lots of work from Michał Mirosław to eliminate the VLAN_TAG_PRESENT
        bit so that we could support the entire vlan_tci value.
    
     5) Rework the IPSEC policy lookups to better optimize more usecases,
        from Florian Westphal.
    
     6) Infrastructure changes eliminating direct manipulation of SKB lists
        wherever possible, and to always use the appropriate SKB list
        helpers. This work is still ongoing...
    
     7) Lots of PHY driver and state machine improvements and
        simplifications, from Heiner Kallweit.
    
     8) Various TSO deferral refinements, from Eric Dumazet.
    
     9) Add ntuple filter support to aquantia driver, from Dmitry Bogdanov.
    
    10) Batch dropping of XDP packets in tuntap, from Jason Wang.
    
    11) Lots of cleanups and improvements to the r8169 driver from Heiner
        Kallweit, including support for ->xmit_more. This driver has been
        getting some much needed love since he started working on it.
    
    12) Lots of new forwarding selftests from Petr Machata.
    
    13) Enable VXLAN learning in mlxsw driver, from Ido Schimmel.
    
    14) Packed ring support for virtio, from Tiwei Bie.
    
    15) Add new Aquantia AQtion USB driver, from Dmitry Bezrukov.
    
    16) Add XDP support to dpaa2-eth driver, from Ioana Ciocoi Radulescu.
    
    17) Implement coalescing on TCP backlog queue, from Eric Dumazet.
    
    18) Implement carrier change in tun driver, from Nicolas Dichtel.
    
    19) Support msg_zerocopy in UDP, from Willem de Bruijn.
    
    20) Significantly improve garbage collection of neighbor objects when
        the table has many PERMANENT entries, from David Ahern.
    
    21) Remove egdev usage from nfp and mlx5, and remove the facility
        completely from the tree as it no longer has any users. From Oz
        Shlomo and others.
    
    22) Add a NETDEV_PRE_CHANGEADDR so that drivers can veto the change and
        therefore abort the operation before the commit phase (which is the
        NETDEV_CHANGEADDR event). From Petr Machata.
    
    23) Add indirect call wrappers to avoid retpoline overhead, and use them
        in the GRO code paths. From Paolo Abeni.
    
    24) Add support for netlink FDB get operations, from Roopa Prabhu.
    
    25) Support bloom filter in mlxsw driver, from Nir Dotan.
    
    26) Add SKB extension infrastructure. This consolidates the handling of
        the auxiliary SKB data used by IPSEC and bridge netfilter, and is
        designed to support the needs to MPTCP which could be integrated in
        the future.
    
    27) Lots of XDP TX optimizations in mlx5 from Tariq Toukan.
