Full commit message:
wifi: iwlwifi: mvm: cleanup beacon_inject_active during hw restart

beacon_inject_active turns true and false via debugfs when we inject a
beacon. During the time of the beacon injection we can't configure the
FW with a beacon cmd. If we have a hw restart during the beacon injection
then in the recovery flow we will not be able to configure the beacon
cmd to the FW. Fix this by cleaning up this variable after an hw restart.
