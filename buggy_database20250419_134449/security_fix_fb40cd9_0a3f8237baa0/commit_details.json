  "body": "beacon_inject_active turns true and false via debugfs when we inject a\nbeacon. During the time of the beacon injection we can't configure the\nFW with a beacon cmd. If we have a hw restart during the beacon injection\nthen in the recovery flow we will not be able to configure the beacon\ncmd to the FW. Fix this by cleaning up this variable after an hw restart.\n\nSigned-off-by: Miri Korenblit <miriam.rachel.korenblit@intel.com>\nSigned-off-by: Gregory Greenman <gregory.greenman@intel.com>\nLink: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20230413213309.b021bce5e162.Ia5a0a0b5d8734f63077ceaac936176a345f8d3d1@changeid\nSigned-off-by: Johannes Berg <johannes.berg@intel.com>",
