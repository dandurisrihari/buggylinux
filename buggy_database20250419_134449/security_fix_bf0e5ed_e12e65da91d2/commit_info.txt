Merge tag 'bcachefs-2025-02-20' of git://evilpiepirate.org/bcachefs

Pull bcachefs fixes from Kent Overstreet:
 "Small stuff:

   - The fsck code for Hongbo's directory i_size patch was wrong, caught
     by transaction restart injection: we now have the CI running
     another test variant with restart injection enabled

   - Another fixup for reflink pointers to missing indirect extents:
     previous fix was for fsck code, this fixes the normal runtime paths

   - Another small srcu lock hold time fix, reported by jpsollie"
