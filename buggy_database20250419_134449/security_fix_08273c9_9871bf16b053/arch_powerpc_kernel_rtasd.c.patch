    powerpc/rtas: arch-wide function token lookup conversions
    
    With the tokens for all implemented RTAS functions now available via
    rtas_function_token(), which is optimal and safe for arbitrary
    contexts, there is no need to use rtas_token() or cache its result.
    
    Most conversions are trivial, but a few are worth describing in more
    detail:
    
    * Error injection token comparisons for lockdown purposes are
      consolidated into a simple predicate: token_is_restricted_errinjct().
    
    * A couple of special cases in block_rtas_call() do not use
      rtas_token() but perform string comparisons against names in the
      function table. These are converted to compare against token values
      instead, which is logically equivalent but less expensive.
    
    * The lookup for the ibm,os-term token can be deferred until needed,
      instead of caching it at boot to avoid device tree traversal during
      panic.
    
    * Since rtas_function_token() accesses a read-only data structure
      without taking any locks, xmon's lookup of set-indicator can be
      performed as needed instead of cached at startup.
