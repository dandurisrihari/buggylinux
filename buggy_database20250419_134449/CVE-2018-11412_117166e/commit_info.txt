Subject: ext4: do not allow external inodes for inline data

CVE Identifiers:
- CVE-2018-11412

Full commit message:
ext4: do not allow external inodes for inline data

The inline data feature was implemented before we added support for
external inodes for xattrs.  It makes no sense to support that
combination, but the problem is that there are a number of extended
attribute checks that are skipped if e_value_inum is non-zero.

Unfortunately, the inline data code is completely e_value_inum
unaware, and attempts to interpret the xattr fields as if it were an
inline xattr --- at which point, Hilarty Ensues.

This addresses CVE-2018-11412.
