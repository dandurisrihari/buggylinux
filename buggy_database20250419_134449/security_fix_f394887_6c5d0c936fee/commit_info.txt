Full commit message:
MAINTAINERS: replace maintainer of FireWire subsystem

In the last few years, I have reviewed patches for FireWire subsystem and
requested sound subsystem maintainer to sent them to mainline, since
FireWire subsystem maintainer has been long absent. This situation is not
preferable since we have some user of sound hardware in IEEE 1394 bus.

I will stand for the maintainer, and work for FireWire core functions and
1394 OHCI driver, as well as sound drivers. This commit replaces the
corresponding entry.

As you know, IEEE 1394 is enough legacy. I would like to schedule the end
of my work in the subsystem. My effort will last next 6 years. In 2026, I
will start strong announcement for users to migrate their work load from
IEEE 1394 bus (e.g. by purchasing alternative devices in USB and hardening
system for them), then in 2029 let me resign the maintainer and close
Linux 1394 project.

My current work focuses on real time data (sampling data) transmission
protocol in packet-oriented communication, thus I would provide less help
to implementations for the other type of protocol; i.e. IPv4/IPv6 over
IEEE 1394 bus (firewire-net), SCSI transport protocol over IEEE 1394 bus
(firewire-sbp2) and iSCSI target (sbp-target).

If receiving few objections from developers, I will start my work to send
fixes for v6.3 prepatch, and PR for future v6.4 or later. I'm pleased if
getting any help until the end.
