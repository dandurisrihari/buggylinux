  "body": "In the last few years, I have reviewed patches for FireWire subsystem and\nrequested sound subsystem maintainer to sent them to mainline, since\nFireWire subsystem maintainer has been long absent. This situation is not\npreferable since we have some user of sound hardware in IEEE 1394 bus.\n\nI will stand for the maintainer, and work for FireWire core functions and\n1394 OHCI driver, as well as sound drivers. This commit replaces the\ncorresponding entry.\n\nAs you know, IEEE 1394 is enough legacy. I would like to schedule the end\nof my work in the subsystem. My effort will last next 6 years. In 2026, I\nwill start strong announcement for users to migrate their work load from\nIEEE 1394 bus (e.g. by purchasing alternative devices in USB and hardening\nsystem for them), then in 2029 let me resign the maintainer and close\nLinux 1394 project.\n\nMy current work focuses on real time data (sampling data) transmission\nprotocol in packet-oriented communication, thus I would provide less help\nto implementations for the other type of protocol; i.e. IPv4/IPv6 over\nIEEE 1394 bus (firewire-net), SCSI transport protocol over IEEE 1394 bus\n(firewire-sbp2) and iSCSI target (sbp-target).\n\nIf receiving few objections from developers, I will start my work to send\nfixes for v6.3 prepatch, and PR for future v6.4 or later.
