KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Make kvmppc_mmu_radix_xlate process/partition table agnostic

kvmppc_mmu_radix_xlate() is used to translate an effective address
through the process tables. The process table and partition tables have
identical layout. Exploit this fact to make the kvmppc_mmu_radix_xlate()
function able to translate either an effective address through the
process tables or a guest real address through the partition tables.
