CVE Identifiers:
- CVE-2014-3647

Full commit message:
KVM: x86: Handle errors when RIP is set during far jumps

Far jmp/call/ret may fault while loading a new RIP.  Currently KVM does not
handle this case, and may result in failed vm-entry once the assignment is
done.  The tricky part of doing so is that loading the new CS affects the
VMCS/VMCB state, so if we fail during loading the new RIP, we are left in
unconsistent state.  Therefore, this patch saves on 64-bit the old CS
descriptor and restores it if loading RIP failed.

This fixes CVE-2014-3647.
