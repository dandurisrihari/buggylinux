    Pull ADM Xen support from Konrad Rzeszutek Wilk:
    
      Features:
       * Allow a Linux guest to boot as initial domain and as normal guests
         on Xen on ARM (specifically ARMv7 with virtualized extensions).  PV
         console, block and network frontend/backends are working.
      Bug-fixes:
       * Fix compile linux-next fallout.
       * Fix PVHVM bootup crashing.
    
      The Xen-unstable hypervisor (so will be 4.3 in a ~6 months), supports
      ARMv7 platforms.
    
      The goal in implementing this architecture is to exploit the hardware
      as much as possible.  That means use as little as possible of PV
      operations (so no PV MMU) - and use existing PV drivers for I/Os
      (network, block, console, etc).  This is similar to how PVHVM guests
      operate in X86 platform nowadays - except that on ARM there is no need
      for QEMU.  The end result is that we share a lot of the generic Xen
      drivers and infrastructure.
    
      Details on how to compile/boot/etc are available at this Wiki:

      and this blog has links to a technical discussion/presentations on the
      overall architecture:
