Full commit message:
scsi: qla2xxx: edif: Use link event to wake up app

Authentication application may be running and in the past tried to probe
driver (app_start) but was unsuccessful. This could be due to the bsg layer
not being ready to service the request. On a successful link up, driver
will use the netlink Link Up event to notify the app to retry the app_start
call.

In another case, app does not poll for new NPIV host. This link up event
would notify app of the presence of a new SCSI host.
