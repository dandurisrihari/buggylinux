  "subject": "Bluetooth: Fix tracking local SSP authentication requirement",
  "body": "When we need to make the decision whether to perform just-works or real\nuser confirmation we need to know the exact local authentication\nrequirement that was passed to the controller. So far conn->auth_type\n(the local requirement) wasn't in one case updated appropriately in fear\nof the user confirmation being rejected later.\n\nThe real problem however was not really that conn->auth_type couldn't\nrepresent the true value but that we were checking the local MITM\nrequirement in an incorrect way. It's perfectly fine to let auth_type\nfollow what we tell the controller since we're still tracking the target\nsecurity level with conn->pending_sec_level.\n\nThis patch updates the check for local MITM requirement in the\nhci_user_confirm_request_evt function to use the locally requested\nsecurity level and ensures that auth_type always represents what we tell\nthe controller. All other code in hci_user_confirm_request_evt still\nuses the auth_type instead of pending_sec_level for determining whether\nto do just-works or not, since that's the only value that's in sync with\nwhat the remote device knows.\n\nSigned-off-by: Johan Hedberg <johan.hedberg@intel.com>\nTested-by: Szymon Janc <szymon.janc@tieto.com>\nSigned-off-by: Marcel Holtmann <marcel@holtmann.org>\nCc: stable@vger.kernel.org # 3.16",
