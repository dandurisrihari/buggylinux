Full commit message:
drm/nouveau/nvif: refactor deprecated strncpy

`strncpy` is deprecated and as such we should prefer more robust and
less ambiguous string interfaces.

A suitable replacement is `strscpy_pad` due to the fact that it
guarantees NUL-termination on the destination buffer whilst also
maintaining the NUL-padding behavior that `strncpy` provides. I am not
sure whether NUL-padding is strictly needed but I see in
`nvif_object_ctor()` args is memcpy'd elsewhere so I figured we'd keep
the same functionality.
