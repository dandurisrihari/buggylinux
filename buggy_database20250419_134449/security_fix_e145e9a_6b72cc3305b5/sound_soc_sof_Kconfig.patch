    ASoC: SOF: Generic probe compress operations
    
    Define system-agnostic probe compress flow which serves as a base for
    actual, hardware-dependent implementations.
    As per firmware spec, maximum of one extraction stream is allowed, while
    for injection, there can be plenty.
    
    Apart from probe_pointer, all probe compress operations are mandatory.
    Copy operation is defined as unified as its flow should be shared across
    all SOF systems.
