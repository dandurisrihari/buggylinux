Otherwise tx() may run into\nuse-after-free because the net_device is freed.\n\nThis patch removed the dev_put(ifp) in the success path in\naoecmd_cfg_pkts(), and added dev_put() after skb xmit in tx().\n\nLink: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-6270\nFixes: 7562f876cd93 (\"[NET]: Rework dev_base via list_head (v3)\")\nSigned-off-by: Chun-Yi Lee <jlee@suse.com>\nLink: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20240305082048.25526-1-jlee@suse.com\nSigned-off-by: Jens Axboe <axboe@kernel.dk>",
