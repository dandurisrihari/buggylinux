Full commit message:
drm/panic: Better binary encoding in QR code

The current encoding, is done by converting 13bits of input into 4
decimal digits, that are then encoded efficiently using the numeric
encoding of the QR code specification.
The Fido v2.2 specification [1] uses a similar approach for its
QR-initiated authentication. The only difference is that it converts
7 bytes (56bits) of input into 17 decimal digits. The benefit is that
the algorithm doesn't require to split input bytes into 13bits chunk,
and the ratio is a bit better.
This improvement was proposed by Jó Ágila Bitsch in [2].
drm_panic is still young, and the QR code feature is not widely used,
so it's still time to switch to a common algorithm, shared with a
widely used standard.
I also changed the name of the url parameter, from zl= to z=, so the
website can keep backward compatibility if needed.
