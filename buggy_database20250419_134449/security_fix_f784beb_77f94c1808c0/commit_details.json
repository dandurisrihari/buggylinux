  "body": "Although ALSA timer code got hardening for races, it still causes\nuse-after-free error.  This is however rather a corrupted linked list,\nnot actually the concurrent accesses.  Namely, when timer start is\ntriggered twice, list_add_tail() is called twice, too.  This ends\nup with the link corruption and triggers KASAN error.\n\nThe simplest fix would be replacing list_add_tail() with\nlist_move_tail(), but fundamentally it's the problem that we don't\ncheck the double start/stop correctly.  So, the right fix here is to\nadd the proper checks to snd_timer_start() and snd_timer_stop() (and\ntheir variants).\n\nBugLink: http://lkml.kernel.org/r/CACT4Y+ZyPRoMQjmawbvmCEDrkBD2BQuH7R09=eOkf5ESK8kJAw@mail.gmail.com\nReported-by: Dmitry Vyukov <dvyukov@google.com>\nCc: <stable@vger.kernel.org>\nSigned-off-by: Takashi Iwai <tiwai@suse.de>",
