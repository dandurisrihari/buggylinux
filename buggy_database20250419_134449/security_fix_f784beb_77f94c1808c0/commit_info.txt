Full commit message:
ALSA: timer: Fix link corruption due to double start or stop

Although ALSA timer code got hardening for races, it still causes
use-after-free error.  This is however rather a corrupted linked list,
not actually the concurrent accesses.  Namely, when timer start is
triggered twice, list_add_tail() is called twice, too.  This ends
up with the link corruption and triggers KASAN error.

The simplest fix would be replacing list_add_tail() with
list_move_tail(), but fundamentally it's the problem that we don't
check the double start/stop correctly.  So, the right fix here is to
add the proper checks to snd_timer_start() and snd_timer_stop() (and
their variants).
