  "body": "If the net.ipv6.conf.*.use_temp_addr sysctl is set to '2',\nthen TCP connections over IPv6 will prefer a 'private' source\naddress.\nThese eventually expire and become invalid, typically after a week,\nbut the time is configurable.\n\nWhen the local address becomes invalid the client will not be able to\nreceive replies from the server.  Eventually the connection will timeout\nor break and a new connection will be established, but this can take\nhalf an hour (typically TCP connection break time).\n\nRFC 4941, which describes private IPv6 addresses, acknowledges that some\napplications might not work well with them and that the application may\nexplicitly a request non-temporary (i.e. \"public\") address.\n\nI believe this is correct for SUNRPC clients.  Without this change, a\nclient will occasionally experience a long delay if private addresses\nhave been enabled.\n\nThe privacy offered by private addresses is of little value for an NFS\nserver which requires client authentication.\n\nFor NFSv3 this will often not be a problem because idle connections are\nclosed after 5 minutes.  For NFSv4 connections never go idle due to the\nperiod RENEW (or equivalent) request.\n\nSigned-off-by: NeilBrown <neilb@suse.com>\nSigned-off-by: Trond Myklebust <trond.myklebust@primarydata.com>",
