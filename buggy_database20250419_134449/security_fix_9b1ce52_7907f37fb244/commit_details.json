  "subject": "mac80211: fix for incorrect sequence number on hostapd injected frames",
  "body": "When hostapd injects a frame, e.g. an authentication or association\nresponse, mac80211 looks for a suitable access point virtual interface\nto associate the frame with based on its source address. This makes it\npossible e.g. to correctly assign sequence numbers to the frames.\n\nA small typo in the ethernet address comparison statement caused a\nfailure to find a suitable ap interface. Sequence numbers on such\nframes where therefore left unassigned causing some clients\n(especially windows-based 11b/g clients) to reject them and fail to\nauthenticate or associate with the access point. This patch fixes the\ntypo in the address comparison statement.\n\nSigned-off-by: Bj\u00f6rn Smedman <bjorn.smedman@venatech.se>\nReviewed-by: Johannes Berg <johannes@sipsolutions.net>\nCc: stable@kernel.org\nSigned-off-by: John W.
