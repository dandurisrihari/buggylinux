Full commit message:
edac: i5100 ack error detection register after each read

If I only ack the detection register after a error have been detected
I'm unable to reliably detect errors. I have verified this behavior
using both an error injection DIMM and software to inject errors.

I can't find any documentation supporting this behavior in Intel 5100
Memory Controller Hub Chipset, see 1. So this is all based on
experimentation.
