[MAC80211]: improve radiotap injection

This improves radiotap injection by removing the shortcut over TX handlers
that led to BUGS when injecting frames without setting a rate and also
resulted in various other quirks. Now, TX handlers are run but some
information that was present in the radiotap header is used instead of
automatic settings.
