Full commit message:
Merge branch 'merge' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/benh/powerpc

Pull powerpc fixes from Ben Herrenschmidt:
 "We discovered some breakage in our "EEH" (PCI Error Handling) code
  while doing error injection, due to a couple of regressions.  One of
  them is due to a patch (37f02195bee9 "powerpc/pci: fix PCI-e devices
  rescan issue on powerpc platform") that, in hindsight, I shouldn't
  have merged considering that it caused more problems than it solved.

  Please pull those two fixes.  One for a simple EEH address cache
  initialization issue.  The other one is a patch from Guenter that I
  had originally planned to put in 3.11 but which happens to also fix
  that other regression (a kernel oops during EEH error handling and
  possibly hotplug).

  With those two, the couple of test machines I've hammered with error
  injection are remaining up now.  EEH appears to still fail to recover
  on some devices, so there is another problem that Gavin is looking
  into but at least it's no longer crashing the kernel."

* 'merge' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/benh/powerpc:
  powerpc/pci: Improve device hotplug initialization
  powerpc/eeh: Add eeh_dev to the cache during boot
