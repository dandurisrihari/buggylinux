  "body": "Pull powerpc fixes from Ben Herrenschmidt:\n \"We discovered some breakage in our \"EEH\" (PCI Error Handling) code\n  while doing error injection, due to a couple of regressions.  One of\n  them is due to a patch (37f02195bee9 \"powerpc/pci: fix PCI-e devices\n  rescan issue on powerpc platform\") that, in hindsight, I shouldn't\n  have merged considering that it caused more problems than it solved.\n\n  Please pull those two fixes.  One for a simple EEH address cache\n  initialization issue.  The other one is a patch from Guenter that I\n  had originally planned to put in 3.11 but which happens to also fix\n  that other regression (a kernel oops during EEH error handling and\n  possibly hotplug).\n\n  With those two, the couple of test machines I've hammered with error\n  injection are remaining up now.  EEH appears to still fail to recover\n  on some devices, so there is another problem that Gavin is looking\n  into but at least it's no longer crashing the kernel.\"\n\n* 'merge' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/benh/powerpc:\n  powerpc/pci: Improve device hotplug initialization\n  powerpc/eeh: Add eeh_dev to the cache during boot",
