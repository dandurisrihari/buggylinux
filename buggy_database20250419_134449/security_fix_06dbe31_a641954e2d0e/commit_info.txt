scsi: lpfc: Add handling for LS_RJT reason explanation authentication required

When a LS_RJT is received with reason explanation authentication required,
current driver logic is to retry the PLOGI up to 48 times.  In the worse
case scenario, 48 retries can take longer than dev_loss_tmo and if there is
an RSCN received indicating an authentication requirement change, the
driver may miss processing it.  Fix by adding logic to specifically handle
reason explanation authentication required and set the max retry count to 8
times.
