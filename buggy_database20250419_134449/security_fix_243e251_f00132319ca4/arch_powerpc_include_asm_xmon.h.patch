    powerpc/xive: Native exploitation of the XIVE interrupt controller
    
    The XIVE interrupt controller is the new interrupt controller
    found in POWER9. It supports advanced virtualization capabilities
    among other things.
    
    Currently we use a set of firmware calls that simulate the old
    "XICS" interrupt controller but this is fairly inefficient.
    
    This adds the framework for using XIVE along with a native
    backend which OPAL for configuration. Later, a backend allowing
    the use in a KVM or PowerVM guest will also be provided.
    
    This disables some fast path for interrupts in KVM when XIVE is
    enabled as these rely on the firmware emulation code which is no
    longer available when the XIVE is used natively by Linux.
    
    A latter patch will make KVM also directly exploit the XIVE, thus
    recovering the lost performance (and more).

     tweak Kconfig so XIVE_NATIVE selects XIVE and depends on POWERNV,
