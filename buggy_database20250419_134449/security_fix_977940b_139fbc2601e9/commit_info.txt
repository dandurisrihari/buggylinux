Full commit message:
staging/rdma/hfi1: optionally prescan rx queue for {B, F}ECNs - UC, RC

To more rapidly respond to Explicit Congestion Notifications, prescan the
receive queue, and process FECNs, and BECNs first.  When a UC, or RC packet
containing a FECN, or BECN is found, immediately react to the ECN (either by
returning a CNP, or adjusting the injection rate). Afterward, the packet will
be processed normally.
