Full commit message:
vfio/pci: Fix potential Spectre v1

info.index can be indirectly controlled by user-space, hence leading
to a potential exploitation of the Spectre variant 1 vulnerability.

This issue was detected with the help of Smatch:

drivers/vfio/pci/vfio_pci.c:734 vfio_pci_ioctl()
warn: potential spectre issue 'vdev->region'

Fix this by sanitizing info.index before indirectly using it to index
vdev->region

Notice that given that speculation windows are large, the policy is
to kill the speculation on the first load and not worry if it can be
completed with a dependent load/store [1].
