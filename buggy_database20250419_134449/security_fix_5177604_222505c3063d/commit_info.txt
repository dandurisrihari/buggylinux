Full commit message:
kvm: x86: fix KVM_XEN_HVM_CONFIG ioctl

This ioctl is obsolete (it was used by Xenner as far as I know) but
still let's not break it gratuitously...  Its handler is copying
directly into struct kvm.  Go through a bounce buffer instead, with
the added benefit that we can actually do something useful with the
flags argument---the previous code was exiting with -EINVAL but still
doing the copy.

This technically is a userspace ABI breakage, but since no one should be
using the ioctl, it's a good occasion to see if someone actually
complains.
