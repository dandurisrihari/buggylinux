  "body": "Until the base value for request service times gets finally computed\nfor a bfq_queue, the inject limit for that queue does depend on the\nthink-time state (short|long) of the queue. A timely update of the\nthink time then guarantees a quicker activation or deactivation of the\ninjection. Fortunately, the think time of a bfq_queue is updated in\nthe same code path as the inject limit; but after the inject limit.\n\nThis commits moves the update of the think time before the update of\nthe inject limit. For coherence, it moves the update of the seek time\ntoo.\n\nReported-by: Srivatsa S. Bhat (VMware) <srivatsa@csail.mit.edu>\nTested-by: Srivatsa S.
