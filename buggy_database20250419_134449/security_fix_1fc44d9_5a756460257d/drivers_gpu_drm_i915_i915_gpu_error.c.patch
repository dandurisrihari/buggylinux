    drm/i915: Store a pointer to intel_context in i915_request
    
    To ease the frequent and ugly pointer dance of
    &request->gem_context->engine[request->engine->id] during request
    submission, store that pointer as request->hw_context. One major
    advantage that we will exploit later is that this decouples the logical
    context state from the engine itself.
    
    v2: Set mock_context->ops so we don't crash and burn in selftests.
        Cleanups from Tvrtko.
