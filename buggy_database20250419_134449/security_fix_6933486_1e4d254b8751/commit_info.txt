Full commit message:
wifi: nl80211: Add support for randomizing TA of auth and deauth frames

Add support to use a random local address in authentication and
deauthentication frames sent to unassociated peer when the driver
supports.

The driver needs to configure receive behavior to accept frames with
random transmit address specified in TX path authentication frames
during the time of the frame exchange is pending and such frames need to
be acknowledged similarly to frames sent to the local permanent address
when this random address functionality is used.

This capability allows use of randomized transmit address for PASN
authentication frames to improve privacy of WLAN clients.
