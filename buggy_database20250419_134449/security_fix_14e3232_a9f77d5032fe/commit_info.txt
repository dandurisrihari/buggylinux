Full commit message:
KVM: x86: Refactor picdev_write() to prevent Spectre-v1/L1TF attacks

This fixes a Spectre-v1/L1TF vulnerability in picdev_write().
It replaces index computations based on the (attacked-controlled) port
number with constants through a minor refactoring.

Fixes: 85f455f7ddbe ("KVM: Add support for in-kernel PIC emulation")
