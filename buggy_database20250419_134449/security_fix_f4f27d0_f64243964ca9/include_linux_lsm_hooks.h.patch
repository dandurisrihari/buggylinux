    Merge branch 'next' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jmorris/linux-security
    
    Pull security subsystem updates from James Morris:
     "Highlights:
    
       - A new LSM, "LoadPin", from Kees Cook is added, which allows forcing
         of modules and firmware to be loaded from a specific device (this
         is from ChromeOS, where the device as a whole is verified
         cryptographically via dm-verity).
    
         This is disabled by default but can be configured to be enabled by
         default (don't do this if you don't know what you're doing).
    
       - Keys: allow authentication data to be stored in an asymmetric key.
         Lots of general fixes and updates.
    
       - SELinux: add restrictions for loading of kernel modules via
         finit_module().  Distinguish non-init user namespace capability
         checks.  Apply execstack check on thread stacks"
