Full commit message:
power: supply: surface_battery: replace deprecated strncpy with strscpy

strncpy() is deprecated for use on NUL-terminated destination strings
[1] and as such we should prefer more robust and less ambiguous string
interfaces.

We expect bat->name to be NUL-terminated based on its usage with
strcmp():

power_supply_core.c:
445: return strcmp(psy->desc->name, name) == 0;

... and also by the manual `... - 1` for the length argument of the
original strncpy() invocation.

Furthermore, no NUL-padding is needed as bat is zero-allocated before
calling spwr_battery_init():
826: bat = devm_kzalloc(&sdev->dev, sizeof(*bat), GFP_KERNEL);
827: if (!bat)
828:   return -ENOMEM;
829:
830: spwr_battery_init(bat, sdev, p->registry, p->name);

... this means any further NUL-byte assignments (like the ones that
strncpy() does) are redundant.

Considering the above, a suitable replacement is `strscpy` [2] due to
the fact that it guarantees NUL-termination on the destination buffer
without unnecessarily NUL-padding.

Let's also opt to use the more idiomatic strscpy() usage of:
(dest, src, sizeof(dest)).
