Full commit message:
powerpc: make feature-fixup tests fortify-safe

Testing the fortified string functions[1] would cause a kernel panic on
boot in test_feature_fixups() due to a buffer overflow in memcmp.

This boils down to things like this:

  extern unsigned int ftr_fixup_test1;
  extern unsigned int ftr_fixup_test1_orig;

  check(memcmp(&ftr_fixup_test1, &ftr_fixup_test1_orig, size) == 0);

We know that these are asm labels so it is safe to read up to 'size'
bytes at those addresses.

However, because we have passed the address of a single unsigned int to
memcmp, the compiler believes the underlying object is in fact a single
unsigned int.  So if size > sizeof(unsigned int), there will be a panic
at runtime.

We can fix this by changing the types: instead of calling the asm labels
unsigned ints, call them unsigned int[]s.  Therefore the size isn't
incorrectly determined at compile time and we get a regular unsafe
memcmp and no panic.
