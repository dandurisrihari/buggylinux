  "body": "In order for frame injection to work properly for some use cases\n(e.g., finding the station entry and keys for encryption), mac80211\nneeds to find the correct sdata entry. This works when the main vif\nis in AP mode, but commit a2c1e3dad516618cb0fbfb1a62c36d0b0744573a\nbroke this particular use case for station main vif. While this type of\ninjection is quite unusual operation, it has some uses and we should fix\nit. Do this by changing the monitor vif sdata selection to allow station\nvif to be selected instead of limiting it to just AP vifs. We still need\nto skip some iftypes to avoid selecting unsuitable vif for injection.\n\nSigned-off-by: Jouni Malinen <jouni.malinen@atheros.com>\nSigned-off-by: John W.
