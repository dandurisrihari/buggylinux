  "body": "The failcmd.sh script in the fault-injection toolkit does not currently\nvalidate whether the provided address is in hexadecimal format.  This can\nlead to silent failures if the address is sourced from places like\n`/proc/kallsyms`, which omits the '0x' prefix, potentially causing users\nto operate under incorrect assumptions.\n\nIntroduce a new function, `exit_if_not_hex`, which checks the format of\nthe provided address and exits with an error message if the address is not\na valid hexadecimal number.\n\nThis enhancement prevents users from running the command with improperly\nformatted addresses, thus improving the robustness and usability of the\nfailcmd tool.\n\nLink: https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20240729084512.3349928-1-leitao@debian.org\nSigned-off-by: Breno Leitao <leitao@debian.org>\nReviewed-by: Akinobu Mita <akinobu.mita@gmail.com>\nSigned-off-by: Andrew Morton <akpm@linux-foundation.org>",
