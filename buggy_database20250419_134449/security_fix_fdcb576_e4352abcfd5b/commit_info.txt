Full commit message:
ALSA: timer: Simplify timer hw resolution calls

There multiple open-codes to get the hardware timer resolution.
Make a local helper function snd_timer_hw_resolution() and call it
from all relevant places.

There is no functional change by this, just a preliminary work for the
following timer resolution hardening patch.
