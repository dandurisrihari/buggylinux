    Pull f2fs updates from Jaegeuk Kim:
     "This round introduces several interesting features such as on-disk NAT
      bitmaps, IO alignment, and a discard thread. And it includes a couple
      of major bug fixes as below.
    
      Enhancements:
    
       - introduce on-disk bitmaps to avoid scanning NAT blocks when getting
         free nids
    
       - support IO alignment to prepare open-channel SSD integration in
         future
    
       - introduce a discard thread to avoid long latency during checkpoint
         and fstrim
    
       - use SSR for warm node and enable inline_xattr by default
    
       - introduce in-memory bitmaps to check FS consistency for debugging
    
       - improve write_begin by avoiding needless read IO
    
      Bug fixes:
    
       - fix broken zone_reset behavior for SMR drive
    
       - fix wrong victim selection policy during GC
    
       - fix missing behavior when preparing discard commands
    
       - fix bugs in atomic write support and fiemap
    
       - workaround to handle multiple f2fs_add_link calls having same name
    
      ... and it includes a bunch of clean-up patches as well"
