Full commit message:
s390/crypto: Display Query and Query Authentication Information in sysfs

Displays the query (fc=0) and query authentication information (fc=127)
as binary in sysfs per CPACF instruction. Files are located in
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpacf/. These information can be fetched via
asm already except for PCKMO because this instruction is privileged. To
offer a unified interface all CPACF instructions will have this
information displayed in sysfs in files <instruction>_query_raw and
<instruction>_query_auth_info_raw.

A new tool introduced into s390-tools called cpacfinfo will use this
information to convert and display in human readable form.
