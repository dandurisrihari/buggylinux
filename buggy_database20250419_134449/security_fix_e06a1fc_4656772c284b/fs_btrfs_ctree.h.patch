    btrfs: Remove extent_io_ops::set_bit_hook extent_io callback
    
    This callback is used to properly account delalloc extents for data
    inodes (ordinary file inodes and freespace v1 inodes). Those can be
    easily identified since they have their extent_io trees ->private_data
    member point to the inode. Let's exploit this fact to remove the
    needless indirection through extent_io_hooks and directly call the
    function. Also give the function a name which reflects its purpose -
    btrfs_set_delalloc_extent.
    
    This patch also modified test_find_delalloc so that the extent_io_tree
    used for testing doesn't have its ->private_data set which would have
    caused a crash in btrfs_set_delalloc_extent due to the btrfs_inode->root
    member not being initialised. The old version of the code also didn't
    call set_bit_hook since the extent_io ops weren't set for the inode.  No
    functional changes.
