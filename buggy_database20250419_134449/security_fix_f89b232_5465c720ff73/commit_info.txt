[PATCH] airo.c: add support for IW_ENCODE_TEMP (i.e. xsupplicant)

Hello Jeff,

this patch changes causes the airo driver to not reset the card when a
temporary WEP key is set, when the IW_ENCODE_TEMP flag is used.  This is
needed for xsupplicant as 802.1x, LEAP, etc. change WEP keys frequently
after authentication and resetting the card causes infinite
reauthentication.

Javier and Jean agree with the patch, Javier suggested I send this to
you, can you apply this?

Thanks.
