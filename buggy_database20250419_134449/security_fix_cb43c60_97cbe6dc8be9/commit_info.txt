Full commit message:
selftests: net: vrf-xfrm-tests: change authentication and encryption algos

The vrf-xfrm-tests tests use the hmac(md5) and cbc(des3_ede)
algorithms for performing authentication and encryption, respectively.
This causes the tests to fail when fips=1 is set, since these algorithms
are not allowed in FIPS mode. Therefore, switch from hmac(md5) and
cbc(des3_ede) to hmac(sha1) and cbc(aes), which are FIPS compliant.
