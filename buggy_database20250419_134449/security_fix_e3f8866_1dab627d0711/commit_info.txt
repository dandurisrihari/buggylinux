Full commit message:
HSI: ssi_protocol: Fix use after free vulnerability in ssi_protocol Driver Due to Race Condition

In the ssi_protocol_probe() function, &ssi->work is bound with
ssip_xmit_work(), In ssip_pn_setup(), the ssip_pn_xmit() function
within the ssip_pn_ops structure is capable of starting the
work.

If we remove the module which will call ssi_protocol_remove()
to make a cleanup, it will free ssi through kfree(ssi),
while the work mentioned above will be used. The sequence
of operations that may lead to a UAF bug is as follows:

CPU0                                    CPU1

                        | ssip_xmit_work
ssi_protocol_remove     |
kfree(ssi);             |
                        | struct hsi_client *cl = ssi->cl;
                        | // use ssi

Fix it by ensuring that the work is canceled before proceeding
with the cleanup in ssi_protocol_remove().
