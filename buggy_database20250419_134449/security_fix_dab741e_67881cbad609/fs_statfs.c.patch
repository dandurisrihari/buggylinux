    Add a "nosymfollow" mount option.
    
    For mounts that have the new "nosymfollow" option, don't follow symlinks
    when resolving paths. The new option is similar in spirit to the
    existing "nodev", "noexec", and "nosuid" options, as well as to the
    LOOKUP_NO_SYMLINKS resolve flag in the openat2(2) syscall. Various BSD
    variants have been supporting the "nosymfollow" mount option for a long
    time with equivalent implementations.
    
    Note that symlinks may still be created on file systems mounted with
    the "nosymfollow" option present. readlink() remains functional, so
    user space code that is aware of symlinks can still choose to follow
    them explicitly.
    
    Setting the "nosymfollow" mount option helps prevent privileged
    writers from modifying files unintentionally in case there is an
    unexpected link along the accessed path. The "nosymfollow" option is
    thus useful as a defensive measure for systems that need to deal with
    untrusted file systems in privileged contexts.
