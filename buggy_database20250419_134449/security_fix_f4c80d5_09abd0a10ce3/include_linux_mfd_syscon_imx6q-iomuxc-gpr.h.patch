    Pull sound updates from Takashi Iwai:
     "This time was again a relatively calm development cycle; most of
      updates are about drivers, and no radical changes are seen in any core
      code.  Here are some highlights:
    
      ALSA core:
       - Continued hardening of ALSA hrtimer
       - A few leak fixes in timer interface
       - Fix poll error handling in PCM and compress
       - Add error propagation in compress API
       - Removal of dead rtctimer driver
    
      HD-audio:
       - Native ELD notify support for i915 HDMI
       - Realtek ALC234 & co support
       - Code refactoring to standardize chmap support
       - Continued development for SKL HDMI core support
    
      Firewire:
       - Apply delayed card registration to all drivers
       - Improved / stabilized the handling of PCM stream start / stop
       - Add tracepoints to dump a part of isochronous packet data
       - Fixed incoming/outgoing packet parameter usages
       - Add support for M-Audio profire series
    
      USB-audio:
       - Fixes for UAC2 clock source
       - SS+ support
       - Workaround for oft-seen repeated sample rate read errors
    
      ASoC:
       - Further slow progress on the topology code
       - Substantial updates and improvements for the da7219, es8328,
         fsl-ssi, Intel and rcar drivers.
       - Compress error handling in WM ADSP driver"
