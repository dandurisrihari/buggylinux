    Merge branch 'akpm' (patches from Andrew)
    
    Merge yet more updates from Andrew Morton:
    
     - lots of little subsystems
    
     - a few post-linux-next MM material. Most of the rest awaits more
       merging of other trees.
    
    Subsystems affected by this series: alpha, procfs, misc, core-kernel,
    bitmap, lib, lz4, checkpatch, nilfs, kdump, rapidio, gcov, bfs, relay,
    resource, ubsan, reboot, fault-injection, lzo, apparmor, and mm (swap,
    memory-hotplug, pagemap, cleanups, and gup).
