  "body": "`strncpy` is deprecated for use on NUL-terminated destination strings [1].\n\nA suitable replacement is `strscpy` [2] due to the fact that it\nguarantees NUL-termination on its destination buffer argument which is\n_not_ the case for `strncpy`!\n\nAlso remove extraneous if-statement as it can never be entered. The\nreturn value from `strncpy` is it's first argument. In this case,\n`...dyndbg_cmd` is an array:\n| \tchar dyndbg_cmd[VPU_DYNDBG_CMD_MAX_LEN];\n             ^^^^^^^^^^\nThis can never be NULL which means `strncpy`'s return value cannot be\nNULL here. Just use `strscpy` which is more robust and results in\nsimpler and less ambiguous code.\n\nMoreover, remove needless `... - 1` as `strscpy`'s implementation\nensures NUL-termination and we do not need to carefully dance around\nending boundaries with a \"- 1\" anymore.\n\nFixes: 5d7422cfb498 (\"accel/ivpu: Add IPC driver and JSM messages\")\nLink: www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#strncpy-on-nul-terminated-strings [1]\nLink: https://manpages.debian.org/testing/linux-manual-4.8/strscpy.9.en.html [2]\nLink: https://github.com/KSPP/linux/issues/90\nCc: linux-hardening@vger.kernel.org\nSigned-off-by: Justin Stitt <justinstitt@google.com>\nReviewed-by: Stanislaw Gruszka <stanislaw.gruszka@linux.intel.com>\nSigned-off-by: Stanislaw Gruszka <stanislaw.gruszka@linux.intel.com>\nLink: https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/msgid/20230824-strncpy-drivers-accel-ivpu-ivpu_jsm_msg-c-v1-1-12d9b52d2dff@google.com",
