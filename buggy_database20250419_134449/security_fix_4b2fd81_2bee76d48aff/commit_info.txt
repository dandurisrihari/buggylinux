Full commit message:
accel/ivpu: refactor deprecated strncpy

`strncpy` is deprecated for use on NUL-terminated destination strings [1].

A suitable replacement is `strscpy` [2] due to the fact that it
guarantees NUL-termination on its destination buffer argument which is
_not_ the case for `strncpy`!

Also remove extraneous if-statement as it can never be entered. The
return value from `strncpy` is it's first argument. In this case,
`...dyndbg_cmd` is an array:
| 	char dyndbg_cmd[VPU_DYNDBG_CMD_MAX_LEN];
             ^^^^^^^^^^
This can never be NULL which means `strncpy`'s return value cannot be
NULL here. Just use `strscpy` which is more robust and results in
simpler and less ambiguous code.

Moreover, remove needless `... - 1` as `strscpy`'s implementation
ensures NUL-termination and we do not need to carefully dance around
ending boundaries with a "- 1" anymore.
