Finishing process_nmi() without a pending NMI will become\nmuch more likely when KVM gains support for AMD's vNMI, which allows\npending vNMIs in hardware, i.e. doesn't require explicit injection.\n\nSigned-off-by: Santosh Shukla <Santosh.Shukla@amd.com>\nLink: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20230227084016.3368-6-santosh.shukla@amd.com\nSigned-off-by: Sean Christopherson <seanjc@google.com>",
