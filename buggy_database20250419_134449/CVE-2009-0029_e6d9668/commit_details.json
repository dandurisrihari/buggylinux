  "body": "Some discussion with the glibc mailing lists revealed that this was\nnecessary for 64-bit platforms with MIPS-like sign-extension rules\nfor 32-bit values.  The original symptom was that passing (uid_t)-1 to\nsetreuid() was failing in programs linked -pthread because of the \"setxid\"\nmechanism for passing setxid-type function arguments to the syscall code.\nSYSCALL_WRAPPERS handles ensuring that all syscall arguments end up with\nproper sign-extension and is thus the appropriate fix for this problem.\n\nOn other platforms (s390, powerpc, sparc64, and mips) this was fixed\nin 2.6.28.6.  The general issue is tracked as CVE-2009-0029.\n\nCc: <stable@vger.kernel.org>\nSigned-off-by: Chris Metcalf <cmetcalf@tilera.com>",
