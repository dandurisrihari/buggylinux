  "body": "According to the Microsoft documentation for Windows 8 convertible\ndevices, these devices should implement a PNP0C60 \"laptop/slate mode state\nindicator\" ACPI device.\n\nThis device can work in 2 ways, if there is a GPIO which directly\nindicates the device is in tablet-mode or not then the direct-gpio mode\nshould be used. If there is no such GPIO, but instead the events are\ncoming from e.g. the embedded-controller, then there should still be\na PNP0C60 ACPI device and event-injection should be used to send the\nevents. The drivers/platform/x86/intel-vbtn.c code is an example from\na standardized manner of doing the latter.\n\nOn various 2-in-1s with either a detachable keyboard, or with 360\u00b0\nhinges, the direct GPIO mode is indicated by an ACPI device with a\nHID of INT33D3, which contains a single GpioInt in its ACPI resource\ntable, which directly indicates if the device is in tablet-mode or not.\n\nThis commit adds support for this to the soc_button_array code, as\nwell as for the alternative ID9001 HID which some devices use\ninstead of the INT33D3 HID.\n\nSigned-off-by: Hans de Goede <hdegoede@redhat.com>\nLink: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20200826150601.12137-3-hdegoede@redhat.com\nSigned-off-by: Dmitry Torokhov <dmitry.torokhov@gmail.com>",
