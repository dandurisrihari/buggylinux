    Input: soc_button_array - add support for INT33D3 tablet-mode switch devices
    
    According to the Microsoft documentation for Windows 8 convertible
    devices, these devices should implement a PNP0C60 "laptop/slate mode state
    indicator" ACPI device.
    
    This device can work in 2 ways, if there is a GPIO which directly
    indicates the device is in tablet-mode or not then the direct-gpio mode
    should be used. If there is no such GPIO, but instead the events are
    coming from e.g. the embedded-controller, then there should still be
    a PNP0C60 ACPI device and event-injection should be used to send the
    events. The drivers/platform/x86/intel-vbtn.c code is an example from
    a standardized manner of doing the latter.
    
    On various 2-in-1s with either a detachable keyboard, or with 360Â°
    hinges, the direct GPIO mode is indicated by an ACPI device with a
    HID of INT33D3, which contains a single GpioInt in its ACPI resource
    table, which directly indicates if the device is in tablet-mode or not.
    
    This commit adds support for this to the soc_button_array code, as
    well as for the alternative ID9001 HID which some devices use
    instead of the INT33D3 HID.
