Full commit message:
kdb: Use the passed prompt in kdb_position_cursor()

The function kdb_position_cursor() takes in a "prompt" parameter but
never uses it. This doesn't _really_ matter since all current callers
of the function pass the same value and it's a global variable, but
it's a bit ugly. Let's clean it up.

Found by code inspection. This patch is expected to functionally be a
no-op.
