Full commit message:
net/mlx5: simplify mlx5_set_driver_version string assignments

In total, just assigning this version string takes:
(1) strncpy()'s
(5) strlen()'s
(3) strncat()'s
(1) snprintf()'s
(4) max_t()'s

Moreover, `strncpy` is deprecated [1] and `strncat` really shouldn't be
used either [2]. With this in mind, let's simply use a single
`snprintf`.
