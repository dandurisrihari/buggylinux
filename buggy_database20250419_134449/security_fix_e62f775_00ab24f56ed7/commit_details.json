  "body": "John W. Linville says:\n\n====================\npull request: wireless 2014-07-24\n\nPlease pull this batch of fixes intended for the 3.16 stream...\n\nFor the mac80211 fixes, Johannes says:\n\n\"I have two fixes: one for tracing that fixes a long-standing NULL\npointer dereference, and one for a mac80211 issue that causes iwlmvm to\nsend invalid frames during authentication/association.\"\n\nand,\n\n\"One more fix - for a bug in the newly introduced code that obtains rate\ncontrol information for stations.\"\n\nFor the iwlwifi fixes, Emmanuel says:\n\n\"It includes a merge damage fix. This region has been changed in -next\nand -fixes quite a few times and apparently, I failed to handle it\nproperly, so here the fix.  Along with that I have a fix from Eliad\nto properly handle overlapping BSS in AP mode.\"\n\nOn top of that, Felix provides and ath9k fix for Tx stalls that happen\nafter an aggregation session failure.\n\nPlease let me know if there are problems!  There are some changes\nhere that will cause merge conflicts in -next.  Once you merge this\nI can pull it into wireless-next and resolve those issues.\n====================\n\nSigned-off-by: David S. Miller <davem@davemloft.net>",
