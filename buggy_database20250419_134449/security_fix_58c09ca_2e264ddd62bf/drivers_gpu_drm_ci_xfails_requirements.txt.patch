    drm/ci: make github dependabot happy again
    
    The drm CI scripts for gitlab have a requirements file that makes the
    github 'dependabot' worry about a few of the required tooling versions.
    
    It wants to update the pip requirements from 23.2.1 to 23.3:
    
     "When installing a package from a Mercurial VCS URL, e.g. pip install
      hg+..., with pip prior to v23.3, the specified Mercurial revision
      could be used to inject arbitrary configuration options to the hg
      clone call (e.g. --config). Controlling the Mercurial configuration
      can modify how and which repository is installed. This vulnerability
      does not affect users who aren't installing from Mercurial"
    
    and upgrade the urllib3 requirements from 2.0.4 to 2.0.7 due to two
    issues:
    
     "urllib3's request body not stripped after redirect from 303 status
      changes request method to GET"
    
     "`Cookie` HTTP header isn't stripped on cross-origin redirects"
    
    The file also ends up not having a newline at the end, that my editor
    ends up wanting to fix automatically.
