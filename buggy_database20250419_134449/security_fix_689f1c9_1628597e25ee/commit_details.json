  "body": "While tracking down the MAX_AH_AUTH_LEN crash in an old kernel\nI thought that this limit was rather arbitrary and we should\njust get rid of it.\n\nIn fact it seems that we've already done all the work needed\nto remove it apart from actually removing it.  This limit was\nthere in order to limit stack usage.  Since we've already\nswitched over to allocating scratch space using kmalloc, there\nis no longer any need to limit the authentication length.\n\nThis patch kills all references to it, including the BUG_ONs\nthat led me here.\n\nSigned-off-by: Herbert Xu <herbert@gondor.apana.org.au>\nSigned-off-by: Steffen Klassert <steffen.klassert@secunet.com>",
