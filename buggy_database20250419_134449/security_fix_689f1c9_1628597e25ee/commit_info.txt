Full commit message:
ipsec: Remove obsolete MAX_AH_AUTH_LEN

While tracking down the MAX_AH_AUTH_LEN crash in an old kernel
I thought that this limit was rather arbitrary and we should
just get rid of it.

In fact it seems that we've already done all the work needed
to remove it apart from actually removing it.  This limit was
there in order to limit stack usage.  Since we've already
switched over to allocating scratch space using kmalloc, there
is no longer any need to limit the authentication length.

This patch kills all references to it, including the BUG_ONs
that led me here.
