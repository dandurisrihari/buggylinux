This is needed for cases where the driver takes\ncare of Authentication frame processing (SME in the driver) so that\ncorrect enforcement of the acceptable PWE derivation mechanism can be\nperformed.\n\nThe userspace applications can pass the sae_pwe value using the\nNL80211_ATTR_SAE_PWE attribute in the NL80211_CMD_CONNECT and\nNL80211_CMD_START_AP commands to the driver. This allows selection\nbetween the hunting-and-pecking loop and hash-to-element options for PWE\nderivation. For backwards compatibility, this new attribute is optional\nand if not included, the driver is notified of the value being\nunspecified.\n\nSigned-off-by: Rohan Dutta <drohan@codeaurora.org>\nSigned-off-by: Jouni Malinen <jouni@codeaurora.org>\nLink: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20201027100910.22283-1-jouni@codeaurora.org\nSigned-off-by: Johannes Berg <johannes.berg@intel.com>",
