    Merge tag 'trace-v5.5-2' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/rostedt/linux-trace
    
    Pull more tracing updates from Steven Rostedt:
     "Two fixes and one patch that was missed:
    
      Fixes:
    
       - Missing __print_hex_dump undef for processing new function in trace
         events
    
       - Stop WARN_ON messages when lockdown disables tracing on boot up
    
      Enhancement:
    
       - Debug option to inject trace events from userspace (for rasdaemon)"
    
    The enhancement has its own config option and is non invasive. It's been
    discussed for sever months and should have been added to my original
    push, but I never pulled it into my queue.
