Full commit message:
Merge branch 'smp-urgent-for-linus' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tip/tip

Pull smp/hotplug fixes from Thomas Gleixner:
 "This addresses the fallout of the new lockdep mechanism which covers
  completions in the CPU hotplug code.

  The lockdep splats are false positives, but there is no way to
  annotate that reliably. The solution is to split the completions for
  CPU up and down, which requires some reshuffling of the failure
  rollback handling as well"
