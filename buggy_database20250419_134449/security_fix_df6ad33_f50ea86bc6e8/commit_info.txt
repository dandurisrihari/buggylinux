Full commit message:
eCryptfs: Filename encryption only supports password auth tokens

Returns -ENOTSUPP when attempting to use filename encryption with
something other than a password authentication token, such as a private
token from openssl.  Using filename encryption with a userspace eCryptfs
key module is a future goal.  Until then, this patch handles the
situation a little better than simply using a BUG_ON().
