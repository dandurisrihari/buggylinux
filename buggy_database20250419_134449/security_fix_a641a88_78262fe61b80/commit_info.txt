Full commit message:
Merge tag 'f2fs-for-5.3' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jaegeuk/f2fs

Pull f2fs updates from Jaegeuk Kim:
 "In this round, we've introduced native swap file support which can
  exploit DIO, enhanced existing checkpoint=disable feature with
  additional mount option to tune the triggering condition, and allowed
  user to preallocate physical blocks in a pinned file which will be
  useful to avoid f2fs fragmentation in append-only workloads. In
  addition, we've fixed subtle quota corruption issue.

  Enhancements:
   - add swap file support which uses DIO
   - allocate blocks for pinned file
   - allow SSR and mount option to enhance checkpoint=disable
   - enhance IPU IOs
   - add more sanity checks such as memory boundary access

  Bug fixes:
   - quota corruption in very corner case of error-injected SPO case
   - fix root_reserved on remount and some wrong counts
   - add missing fsck flag

  Some patches were also introduced to clean up ambiguous i_flags and
  debugging messages codes"
