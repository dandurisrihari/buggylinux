    crypto: sm4 - introduce SM4 symmetric cipher algorithm
    
    Introduce the SM4 cipher algorithms (OSCCA GB/T 32907-2016).
    
    SM4 (GBT.32907-2016) is a cryptographic standard issued by the
    Organization of State Commercial Administration of China (OSCCA)
    as an authorized cryptographic algorithms for the use within China.
    
    SMS4 was originally created for use in protecting wireless
    networks, and is mandated in the Chinese National Standard for
    Wireless LAN WAPI (Wired Authentication and Privacy Infrastructure)
    (GB.15629.11-2003).
