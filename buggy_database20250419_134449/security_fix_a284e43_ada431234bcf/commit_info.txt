Full commit message:
hardening: Enable KCFI and some other options

Add some stuff that got missed along the way:

- CONFIG_UNWIND_PATCH_PAC_INTO_SCS=y so SCS vs PAC is hardware
  selectable.

- CONFIG_X86_KERNEL_IBT=y while a default, just be sure.

- CONFIG_CFI_CLANG=y globally.

- CONFIG_PAGE_TABLE_CHECK=y for userspace mapping sanity.
