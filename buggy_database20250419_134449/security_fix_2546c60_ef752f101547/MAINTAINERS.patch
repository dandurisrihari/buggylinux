    platform/x86: Add Intel Software Defined Silicon driver
    
    Intel Software Defined Silicon (SDSi) is a post manufacturing mechanism for
    activating additional silicon features. Features are enabled through a
    license activation process.  The SDSi driver provides a per socket, sysfs
    attribute interface for applications to perform 3 main provisioning
    functions:
    
    1. Provision an Authentication Key Certificate (AKC), a key written to
       internal NVRAM that is used to authenticate a capability specific
       activation payload.
    
    2. Provision a Capability Activation Payload (CAP), a token authenticated
       using the AKC and applied to the CPU configuration to activate a new
       feature.
    
    3. Read the SDSi State Certificate, containing the CPU configuration
       state.
    
    The operations perform function specific mailbox commands that forward the
    requests to SDSi hardware to perform authentication of the payloads and
    enable the silicon configuration (to be made available after power
    cycling).
    
    The SDSi device itself is enumerated as an auxiliary device from the
    intel_vsec driver and as such has a build dependency on CONFIG_INTEL_VSEC.
