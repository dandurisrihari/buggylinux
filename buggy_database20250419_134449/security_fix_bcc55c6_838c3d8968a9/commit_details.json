  "body": "The last eight bytes of the password field were not cleared when doing lanman plaintext password authentication. This patch fixes that.\n\nI tested it with Samba by setting password\nencryption to no in the server's smb.conf.  Other servers also can be\nconfigured to force plaintext authentication.    Note that plaintexti\nauthentication requires setting /proc/fs/cifs/SecurityFlags to 0x30030\non the client (enabling both LANMAN and also plaintext password support).\nAlso note that LANMAN support (and thus plaintext password support) requires\nCONFIG_CIFS_WEAK_PW_HASH to be enabled in menuconfig.\n\nCC: Jeff Layton <jlayton@redhat.com>\nCC: Stable Kernel <stable@vger.kernel.org>\nSigned-off-by: Steve French <sfrench@us.ibm.com>",
