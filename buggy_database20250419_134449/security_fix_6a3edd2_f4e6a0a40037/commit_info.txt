Full commit message:
mm: release private data before split THP

If there is private data attached to a THP, the refcount of THP will be
increased and will prevent the THP from being split.  Attempt to release
any private data attached to the THP before attempting the split to
increase the chance of splitting successfully.

There was a memory failure issue hit during HW error injection testing
with 5.18 kernel + xfs as rootfs.  The test was killed and a system reboot
was required to re-run the test.

The issue was tracked down to a THP split failure caused by the memory
failure not being handled.  The page dump showed:

It was like the error was injected to a large folio for xfs with private
data attached.

With private data released before splitting the THP, the test case could
be run successfully many times without rebooting the system.
