Merge tag 'char-misc-4.15-rc8' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/char-misc

Pull char/misc fixes from Greg KH:
 "Here are two bugfixes for some driver bugs for 4.15-rc8

  The first is a bluetooth security bug that has been ignored by the
  Bluetooth developers for months for no obvious reason at all, so I've
  taken it through my tree.

  The second is a simple double-free bug in the mux subsystem.

  Both have been in linux-next for a while with no reported issues"

* tag 'char-misc-4.15-rc8' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/char-misc:
  mux: core: fix double get_device()
  Bluetooth: Prevent stack info leak from the EFS element.
