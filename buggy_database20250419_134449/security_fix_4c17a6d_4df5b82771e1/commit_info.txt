Full commit message:
CIFS: fix type confusion in copy offload ioctl

This might lead to local privilege escalation (code execution as
kernel) for systems where the following conditions are met:

 - CONFIG_CIFS_SMB2 and CONFIG_CIFS_POSIX are enabled
 - a cifs filesystem is mounted where:
  - the mount option "vers" was used and set to a value >=2.0
  - the attacker has write access to at least one file on the filesystem

To attack this, an attacker would have to guess the target_tcon
pointer (but guessing wrong doesn't cause a crash, it just returns an
error code) and win a narrow race.
