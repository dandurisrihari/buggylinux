Full commit message:
um,ethertap: Replace deprecated strncpy() with strscpy()

`strncpy` is deprecated for use on NUL-terminated destination strings [1].

`gate_buf` should always be NUL-terminated and does not require
NUL-padding. It is used as a string arg inside an argv array given to
`run_helper()`. Due to this, let's use `strscpy` as it guarantees
NUL-terminated on the destination buffer preventing potential buffer
overreads [2].

This exact invocation was changed from `strcpy` to `strncpy` in commit
7879b1d94badb ("um,ethertap: use strncpy") back in 2015. Let's continue
hardening our `str*cpy` apis and use the newer and safer `strscpy`!
