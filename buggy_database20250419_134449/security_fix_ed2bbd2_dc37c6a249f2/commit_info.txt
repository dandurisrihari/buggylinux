Full commit message:
powerpc: add security.config, enforcing lockdown=integrity

It's sometimes handy to have a config that boots a bit like a system
under secure boot (forcing lockdown=integrity, without needing any
extra stuff like a command line option).

This config file allows that, and also turns on a few assorted security
and hardening options for good measure.
