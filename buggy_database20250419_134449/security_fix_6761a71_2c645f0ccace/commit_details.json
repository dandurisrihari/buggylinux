  "body": "In roaming flows and during reassociation, its possible that data frames\nsuch as EAPOLs for 4 way handshake/ 802.1x authentication are initially set\nto higher MCS rate. Though these are pruned down to a lower legacy rate\nbefore sending to the FW, driver also emits a kernel warning - intended for\nnon-data frames. Add checks to avoid such warnings for data frames, while\nalso enhancing the debug data printed.\n\nSigned-off-by: Krishnanand Prabhu <krishnanand.prabhu@intel.com>\nSigned-off-by: Luca Coelho <luciano.coelho@intel.com>\nLink: https://lore.kernel.org/r/iwlwifi.20210117164916.d9ded010c4ce.Ie1d5a33d7175c0bcb35c10b5729748646671da31@changeid\nSigned-off-by: Luca Coelho <luciano.coelho@intel.com>",
