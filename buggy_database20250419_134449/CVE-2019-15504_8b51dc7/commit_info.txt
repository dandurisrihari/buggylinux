Full commit message:
rsi: fix a double free bug in rsi_91x_deinit()

`dev` (struct rsi_91x_usbdev *) field of adapter
(struct rsi_91x_usbdev *) is allocated  and initialized in
`rsi_init_usb_interface`. If any error is detected in information
read from the device side,  `rsi_init_usb_interface` will be
freed. However, in the higher level error handling code in
`rsi_probe`, if error is detected, `rsi_91x_deinit` is called
again, in which `dev` will be freed again, resulting double free.

This patch fixes the double free by removing the free operation on
`dev` in `rsi_init_usb_interface`, because `rsi_91x_deinit` is also
used in `rsi_disconnect`, in that code path, the `dev` field is not
 (and thus needs to be) freed.

This bug was found in v4.19, but is also present in the latest version
of kernel. Fixes CVE-2019-15504.
