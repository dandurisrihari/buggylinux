Jonathan writes:

First set of IIO fixes for the 4.5 cycle.

This set comprises those not dependent on patches in the 4.5 merge cycle.
A second set will follow shortly with ones that are.

* core in kernel interfaces
  - fix a possible NULL dereference that is a theoretical possibility
    via odd usage of iio_channel_release. Pretty much a hardening of
    the interface, but observed in the wild with the twl4030_charger
    driver.
* acpi-als
  - report the data as processed as it is in lux.  This fixes a wrong
    use of the IIO ABI.  However, old _raw version retained to avoid
    breaking any userspace in the wild that is relying on that (none
    known but it doesn't hurt us much to retain it)
* ade7753
  - fix some error handling to avoid use of unitialized data.
* ltr501
  - use a signed return type for ltr501_match_samp_freq so as to allow
    returning of an error code.
* mcp4725
  - set name field of struct iio_dev to ensure the sysfs name attribute
    doesn't give NULL.
* mpl115
  - temperature offset sign is wrong.
* stk8ba50
  - IIO_TRIGGER dependency added
* ti_am335x_adc
  - Label buffer as a software buffer. It's actually a hybrid of a
    true hardware buffer feeding a kfifo, but the meaning of these fields
    has changed a little recently and in this case it should be labeled
    a software buffer ensure it is allowed to use the kfifo.
* vf610_adc
  - HAS_IOMEM dependency
