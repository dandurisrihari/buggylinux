    First set of IIO fixes for the 4.5 cycle.
    
    This set comprises those not dependent on patches in the 4.5 merge cycle.
    A second set will follow shortly with ones that are.
    
    * core in kernel interfaces
      - fix a possible NULL dereference that is a theoretical possibility
        via odd usage of iio_channel_release. Pretty much a hardening of
        the interface, but observed in the wild with the twl4030_charger
        driver.
    * acpi-als
      - report the data as processed as it is in lux.  This fixes a wrong
        use of the IIO ABI.  However, old _raw version retained to avoid
        breaking any userspace in the wild that is relying on that (none
        known but it doesn't hurt us much to retain it)
    * ade7753
      - fix some error handling to avoid use of unitialized data.
    * ltr501
      - use a signed return type for ltr501_match_samp_freq so as to allow
        returning of an error code.
    * mcp4725
      - set name field of struct iio_dev to ensure the sysfs name attribute
        doesn't give NULL.
    * mpl115
      - temperature offset sign is wrong.
    * stk8ba50
      - IIO_TRIGGER dependency added
    * ti_am335x_adc
      - Label buffer as a software buffer. It's actually a hybrid of a
        true hardware buffer feeding a kfifo, but the meaning of these fields
        has changed a little recently and in this case it should be labeled
        a software buffer ensure it is allowed to use the kfifo.
    * vf610_adc
      - HAS_IOMEM dependency
