Full commit message:
bpf: Fix propagation of signed bounds from 64-bit min/max into 32-bit.

Similar to unsigned bounds propagation fix signed bounds.
The 'Fixes' tag is a hint. There is no security bug here.
The verifier was too conservative.

Fixes: 3f50f132d840 ("bpf: Verifier, do explicit ALU32 bounds tracking")
