Full commit message:
cifs: Add a variable specific to NTLMSSP for key exchange.

Add a variable specific to NTLMSSP authentication to determine
whether to exchange keys during negotiation and authentication phases.

Since session key for smb1 is per smb connection, once a very first
sesion is established, there is no need for key exchange during
subsequent session setups. As a result, smb1 session setup code sets this
variable as false.

Since session key for smb2 and smb3 is per smb connection, we need to
exchange keys to generate session key for every sesion being established.
As a result, smb2/3 session setup code sets this variable as true.
