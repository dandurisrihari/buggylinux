As a result, smb1 session setup code sets this\nvariable as false.\n\nSince session key for smb2 and smb3 is per smb connection, we need to\nexchange keys to generate session key for every sesion being established.\nAs a result, smb2/3 session setup code sets this variable as true.\n\nAcked-by: Jeff Layton <jlayton@samba.org>\nSigned-off-by: Shirish Pargaonkar <shirishpargaonkar@gmail.com>\nSigned-off-by: Steve French <smfrench@gmail.com>",
