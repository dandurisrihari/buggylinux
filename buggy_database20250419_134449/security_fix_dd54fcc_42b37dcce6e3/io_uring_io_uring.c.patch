    Merge tag 'io_uring-6.13-20242901' of git://git.kernel.dk/linux
    
    Pull more io_uring updates from Jens Axboe:
    
     - Remove a leftover struct from when the cqwait registered waiting was
       transitioned to regions.
    
     - Fix for an issue introduced in this merge window, where nop->fd might
       be used uninitialized. Ensure it's always set.
    
     - Add capping of the task_work run in local task_work mode, to prevent
       bursty and long chains from adding too much latency.
    
     - Work around xa_store() leaving ->head non-NULL if it encounters an
       allocation error during storing. Just a debug trigger, and can go
       away once xa_store() behaves in a more expected way for this
       condition. Not a major thing as it basically requires fault injection
       to trigger it.
    
     - Fix a few mapping corner cases
    
     - Fix KCSAN complaint on reading the table size post unlock. Again not
       a "real" issue, but it's easy to silence by just keeping the reading
       inside the lock that protects it.
