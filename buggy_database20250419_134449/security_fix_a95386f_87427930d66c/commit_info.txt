Full commit message:
nfc: af_nfc: Fix Spectre v1 vulnerability

proto is indirectly controlled by user-space, hence leading to
a potential exploitation of the Spectre variant 1 vulnerability.

This issue was detected with the help of Smatch:

net/nfc/af_nfc.c:42 nfc_sock_create() warn: potential spectre issue 'proto_tab' [w] (local cap)

Fix this by sanitizing proto before using it to index proto_tab.

Notice that given that speculation windows are large, the policy is
to kill the speculation on the first load and not worry if it can be
completed with a dependent load/store [1].
