Full commit message:
svm: Add interrupt injection via AVIC

This patch introduces a new mechanism to inject interrupt using AVIC.
Since VINTR is not supported when enable AVIC, we need to inject
interrupt via APIC backing page instead.

This patch also adds support for AVIC doorbell, which is used by
KVM to signal a running vcpu to check IRR for injected interrupts.
