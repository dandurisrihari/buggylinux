Full commit message:
block, bfq: initialize bfqq->decrease_time_jif correctly

Inject limit is updated or reset when time_is_before_eq_jiffies(
decrease_time_jif + several msecs) or think-time state changes.
decrease_time_jif is initialized to 0 and will be set to current jiffies
when inject limit is updated or reset. If the jiffies is slightly greater
than LONG_MAX, time_is_after_eq_jiffies(0) will keep for a long time, so as
time_is_after_eq_jiffies(decrease_time_jif + several msecs). If the
think-time state never chages, then the injection will not work as expected
for long time.

To be more specific:
Function bfq_update_inject_limit maybe triggered when jiffies pasts
decrease_time_jif + msecs_to_jiffies(10) in bfq_add_request by setting
bfqd->wait_dispatch to true.
Function bfq_reset_inject_limit are called in two conditions:
1. jiffies pasts bfqq->decrease_time_jif + msecs_to_jiffies(1000) in
function bfq_add_request.
2. jiffies pasts bfqq->decrease_time_jif + msecs_to_jiffies(100) or
bfq think-time state change from short to long.

Fix this by initializing bfqq->decrease_time_jif to current jiffies
to trigger service injection soon when service injection conditions
are met.
