This mitigates\nknown attacks, although new (unknown) aggregation-based attacks may\nremain possible.\n\nThis defense works because in A-MSDU aggregation injection attacks, a\nnormal encrypted Wi-Fi frame is turned into an A-MSDU frame. This means\nthe first 6 bytes of the first A-MSDU subframe correspond to an RFC1042\nheader. In other words, the destination MAC address of the first A-MSDU\nsubframe contains the start of an RFC1042 header during an aggregation\nattack. We can detect this and thereby prevent this specific attack.\nFor details, see Section 7.2 of \"Fragment and Forge: Breaking Wi-Fi\nThrough Frame Aggregation and Fragmentation\".\n\nSigned-off-by: Felix Fietkau <nbd@nbd.name>\nSigned-off-by: Kalle Valo <kvalo@codeaurora.org>\nLink: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20210513070303.20253-1-nbd@nbd.name",
