A problem is present in those two syncs: when yet\nanother dvb_demux_open() is called during those sync waits,\ndvb_demux_open() continues to process even if the device is being\nclosed.  This includes the increment of the former refcount, resulting\nin the leftover refcount after the sync of the latter refcount at\ndvb_dmxdev_release().  It ends up with use-after-free, since the\nfunction believes that all usages were gone and releases the\nresources.\n\nThis patch addresses the problem by adding the check of dmxdev->exit\nflag at dvb_demux_open(), just like dvb_dvr_open() already does.
