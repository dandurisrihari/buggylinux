    arm64: Add support of PAuth QARMA3 architected algorithm
    
    QARMA3 is relaxed version of the QARMA5 algorithm which expected to
    reduce the latency of calculation while still delivering a suitable
    level of security.
    
    Support for QARMA3 can be discovered via ID_AA64ISAR2_EL1
    
        APA3, bits [15:12] Indicates whether the QARMA3 algorithm is
                           implemented in the PE for address
                           authentication in AArch64 state.
    
        GPA3, bits [11:8]  Indicates whether the QARMA3 algorithm is
                           implemented in the PE for generic code
                           authentication in AArch64 state.
