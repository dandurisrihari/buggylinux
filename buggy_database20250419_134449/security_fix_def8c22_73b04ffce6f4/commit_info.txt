Full commit message:
arm64: Add support of PAuth QARMA3 architected algorithm

QARMA3 is relaxed version of the QARMA5 algorithm which expected to
reduce the latency of calculation while still delivering a suitable
level of security.

Support for QARMA3 can be discovered via ID_AA64ISAR2_EL1

    APA3, bits [15:12] Indicates whether the QARMA3 algorithm is
                       implemented in the PE for address
                       authentication in AArch64 state.

    GPA3, bits [11:8]  Indicates whether the QARMA3 algorithm is
                       implemented in the PE for generic code
                       authentication in AArch64 state.
