  "body": "The public Intel Xeon 5500 volume 2 datasheet describes, on page 53,\nsession 2.6.7 a register that can lock/unlock Memory Controller the\nconfiguration register, called MC_CFG_CONTROL.\n\nAdds support for it in the hope that software error injection would\nwork. With my tests with Xeon 35xx, there's still something missing.\nWith a program that does sequencial bit writes at dev 0.0, sometimes, it\nproduces error injection, after unblocking the MC_CFG_CONTROL (and,\nsometimes, it just locks my testing machine).\n\nI'll try later to discover by trial and error what's the register that\nsolves this issue on Xeon 35xx.\n\nSigned-off-by: Mauro Carvalho Chehab <mchehab@redhat.com>",
