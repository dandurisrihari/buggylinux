    Pull sound updates from Takashi Iwai:
     "As shown in diffstat and logs, it was again a busy development cycle
      at this time, too. The most significant changes are still on-going
      refactoring / modernization works for ASoC core and drivers, but there
      are lots of other changes as well. Here we go, some highlights below:
    
      ASoC:
    
       - Quite a lot of cleanup / refactoring of ASoC core and APIs; most of
         them are systematic, but also including cleanups and modernization
    
       - A bulk of updates for some ASoC platforms, Freescale, sunxi and
         Intel SST/SOF
    
       - Initial support for Sound Open Firmware on i.MX8
    
       - Removal of deprecated w90x900 and nuc900 drivers
    
       - New support for Cirrus Logic CS47L15 and CS47L92, Freescale i.MX
         7ULP and 8MQ, Meson G12A and NXP UDA1334
    
      USB-audio:
    
       - More validations of descriptor units for hardening against bugs
         reported by fuzzers
    
       - PCM device assignment workaround for a past call-order change
    
       - Scarlett Gen2 mixer interface, a few more more quirks
    
      HD-audio:
    
       - Support for audio component with AMD/ATI and Nvidia HDMI codecs
    
       - Clean up HD-audio core and remove indirect access ops for Intel SOF
    
       - DMIC detection at probe; it would make systems automatically
         falling back to SST/SOF driver on devices that need DMIC handling.
         Needs a new Kconfig to set, and beware that it's still new and a
         bit experimental
    
      FireWire:
    
       - Lots of code refactoring and cleanups"
