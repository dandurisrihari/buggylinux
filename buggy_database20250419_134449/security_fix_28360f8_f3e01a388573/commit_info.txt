Full commit message:
KVM: x86: Evaluate ability to inject SMI/NMI/IRQ after potential VM-Exit

Determine whether or not new events can be injected after checking nested
events.  If a VM-Exit occurred during nested event handling, any previous
event that needed re-injection is gone from's KVM perspective; the event
is captured in the vmc*12 VM-Exit information, but doesn't exist in terms
of what needs to be done for entry to L1.
