Full commit message:
power: supply: surface-charger: replace deprecated strncpy with strscpy

strncpy() is deprecated for use on NUL-terminated destination strings
[1] and as such we should prefer more robust and less ambiguous string
interfaces.

We expect ac->name to be NUL-terminated based on its usage with format
strings:

surface_charger.c:
190: ac->psy_desc.name = ac->name;

...

power_supply_core.c:
174: dev_dbg(&psy->dev, "%s: Found supply : %s\n",
175:   psy->desc->name, epsy->desc->name);

Moreover, NUL-padding is not required as ac is already zero-allocated
before being passed to spwr_ac_init():

surface_charger.c:
240: ac = devm_kzalloc(&sdev->dev, sizeof(*ac), GFP_KERNEL);
241: if (!ac)
242:   return -ENOMEM;
243:
244: spwr_ac_init(ac, sdev, p->registry, p->name);

... this means any future NUL-byte assignments (like the ones that
strncpy() does) are redundant.

Considering the above, a suitable replacement is `strscpy` [2] due to
the fact that it guarantees NUL-termination on the destination buffer
without unnecessarily NUL-padding.

Let's also opt for the more idiomatic strscpy() usage of:
(dest, src, sizeof(dest))
