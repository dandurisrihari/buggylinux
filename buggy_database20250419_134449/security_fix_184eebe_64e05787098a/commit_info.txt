Full commit message:
cfg80211/mac80211: add connected to auth server to meshconf

Besides information about num of peerings and gate connectivity,
the mesh formation byte also contains a flag for authentication
server connectivity, that currently cannot be set in the mesh conf.
This patch adds this capability, which is necessary to implement
802.1X authentication in mesh mode.
