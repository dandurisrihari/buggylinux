Full commit message:
wifi: rtw88: Fix action frame transmission fail before association

For combo chips, antennas were controlled by bluetooth only during
power on. If WiFi wish to do transmission, notification to the coexistence
module are required. Previously we only do this before authentication.
To allow transmission before auth, such as management TX, now we start
the initiation of coexistence earlier so antennas are shared between
WiFi and bluetooth after set_channel(), and frames could then be sent.
