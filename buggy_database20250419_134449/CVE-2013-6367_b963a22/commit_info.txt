Full commit message:
KVM: x86: Fix potential divide by 0 in lapic (CVE-2013-6367)

Under guest controllable circumstances apic_get_tmcct will execute a
divide by zero and cause a crash.  If the guest cpuid support
tsc deadline timers and performs the following sequence of requests
the host will crash.
- Set the mode to periodic
- Set the TMICT to 0
- Set the mode bits to 11 (neither periodic, nor one shot, nor tsc deadline)
- Set the TMICT to non-zero.
Then the lapic_timer.period will be 0, but the TMICT will not be.  If the
guest then reads from the TMCCT then the host will perform a divide by 0.

This patch ensures that if the lapic_timer.period is 0, then the division
does not occur.
