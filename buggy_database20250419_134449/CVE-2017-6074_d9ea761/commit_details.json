So one can free the ccid object twice from two socks after\ncloning.\n\nThis issue was found by \"Hadar Manor\" as well and assigned with\nCVE-2020-16119, which was fixed in Ubuntu's kernel. So here I port\nthe patch from Ubuntu to fix it.\n\nThe patch prevents cloned socks from referencing the same ccid.\n\nFixes: 2677d2067731410 (\"dccp: don't free ccid2_hc_tx_sock ...\")\nSigned-off-by: Zhenpeng Lin <zplin@psu.edu>\nSigned-off-by: David S.
