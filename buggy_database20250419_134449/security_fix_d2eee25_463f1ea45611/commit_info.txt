Full commit message:
Merge tag 'for-5.6-rc2-tag' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/kdave/linux

Pull btrfs fixes from David Sterba:
 "These are fixes that were found during testing with help of error
  injection, plus some other stable material.

  There's a fixup to patch added to rc1 causing locking in wrong context
  warnings, tests found one more deadlock scenario. The patches are
  tagged for stable, two of them now in the queue but we'd like all
  three released at the same time.

  I'm not happy about fixes to fixes in such a fast succession during
  rcs, but I hope we found all the fallouts of commit 28553fa992cb
  ('Btrfs: fix race between shrinking truncate and fiemap')"
