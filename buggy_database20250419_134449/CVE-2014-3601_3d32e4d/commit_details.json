  "body": "The third parameter of kvm_unpin_pages() when called from\nkvm_iommu_map_pages() is wrong, it should be the number of pages to un-pin\nand not the page size.\n\nThis error was facilitated with an inconsistent API: kvm_pin_pages() takes\na size, but kvn_unpin_pages() takes a number of pages, so fix the problem\nby matching the two.\n\nThis was introduced by commit 350b8bd (\"kvm: iommu: fix the third parameter\nof kvm_iommu_put_pages (CVE-2014-3601)\"), which fixes the lack of\nun-pinning for pages intended to be un-pinned (i.e. memory leak) but\nunfortunately potentially aggravated the number of pages we un-pin that\nshould have stayed pinned. As far as I understand though, the same\npractical mitigations apply.\n\nThis issue was found during review of Red Hat 6.6 patches to prepare\nKsplice rebootless updates.\n\nThanks to Vegard for his time on a late Friday evening to help me in\nunderstanding this code.\n\nFixes: 350b8bd (\"kvm: iommu: fix the third parameter of...
