    Pull block updates from Jens Axboe:
    
     - NVMe updates via Christoph:
          - Small improvements to the logging functionality (Amit Engel)
          - Authentication cleanups (Hannes Reinecke)
          - Cleanup and optimize the DMA mapping cod in the PCIe driver
            (Keith Busch)
          - Work around the command effects for Format NVM (Keith Busch)
          - Misc cleanups (Keith Busch, Christoph Hellwig)
          - Fix and cleanup freeing single sgl (Keith Busch)
    
     - MD updates via Song:
          - Fix a rare crash during the takeover process
          - Don't update recovery_cp when curr_resync is ACTIVE
          - Free writes_pending in md_stop
          - Change active_io to percpu
    
     - Updates to drbd, inching us closer to unifying the out-of-tree driver
       with the in-tree one (Andreas, Christoph, Lars, Robert)
    
     - BFQ update adding support for multi-actuator drives (Paolo, Federico,
       Davide)
    
     - Make brd compliant with REQ_NOWAIT (me)
    
     - Fix for IOPOLL and queue entering, fixing stalled IO waiting on
       timeouts (me)
    
     - Fix for REQ_NOWAIT with multiple bios (me)
    
     - Fix memory leak in blktrace cleanup (Greg)
    
     - Clean up sbitmap and fix a potential hang (Kemeng)
    
     - Clean up some bits in BFQ, and fix a bug in the request injection
       (Kemeng)
    
     - Clean up the request allocation and issue code, and fix some bugs
       related to that (Kemeng)
    
     - ublk updates and fixes:
          - Add support for unprivileged ublk (Ming)
          - Improve device deletion handling (Ming)
          - Misc (Liu, Ziyang)
    
     - s390 dasd fixes (Alexander, Qiheng)
    
     - Improve utility of request caching and fixes (Anuj, Xiao)
    
     - zoned cleanups (Pankaj)
    
     - More constification for kobjs (Thomas)
    
     - blk-iocost cleanups (Yu)
    
     - Remove bio splitting from drivers that don't need it (Christoph)
    
     - Switch blk-cgroups to use struct gendisk. Some of this is now
       incomplete as select late reverts were done. (Christoph)
    
     - Add bvec initialization helpers, and convert callers to use that
       rather than open-coding it (Christoph)
    
     - Misc fixes and cleanups (Jinke, Keith, Arnd, Bart, Li, Martin,
       Matthew, Ulf, Zhong)
