Full commit message:
nl80211: Introduce NL80211_MESH_SETUP_USERSPACE_AMPE

Introduce a new configuration option to support AMPE from userspace.

Prior to this series we only supported authentication in userspace: an
authentication daemon would authenticate peer candidates in userspace
and hand them over to the kernel.  From that point the mesh stack would
take over and establish a peer link (Mesh Peering Management).

These patches introduce support for Authenticated Mesh Peering Exchange
in userspace.  The userspace daemon implements the AMPE protocol and on
successfull completion create mesh peers and install encryption keys.
