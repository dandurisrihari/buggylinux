    mac80211: fix suspend vs. authentication race
    
    Since Stanislaw's patch removing the quiescing code, mac80211 had
    a race regarding suspend vs. authentication: as cfg80211 doesn't
    track authentication attempts, it can't abort them. Therefore the
    attempts may be kept running while suspending, which can lead to
    all kinds of issues, in at least some cases causing an error in
    iwlmvm firmware.
    
    Fix this by aborting the authentication attempt when suspending.
