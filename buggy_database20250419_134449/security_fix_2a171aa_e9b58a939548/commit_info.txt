Merge branch 'akpm' (patches from Andrew)

Merge misc fixes from Andrew Morton:
 "16 patches

  This includes a new rtc driver for the Abracon AB x80x and isn't very
  appropriate for -rc2.  It was still being fiddled with a bit during
  the merge window and I fell asleep during -rc1"

[ So I took the new driver, it seems small and won't regress anything.
  I'm a softy.   - Linus ]
