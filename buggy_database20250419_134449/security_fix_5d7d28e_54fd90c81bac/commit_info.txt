====================
tipc: add more features to TIPC encryption

This series adds some new features to TIPC encryption:

- Patch 1 ("tipc: optimize key switching time and logic") optimizes the
code and logic in preparation for the following commits.

- Patch 2 ("tipc: introduce encryption master key") introduces support
of 'master key' for authentication of new nodes and key exchange. A
master key can be set/changed by user via netlink (eg. using the same
'tipc node set key' command in iproute2/tipc).

- Patch 3 ("tipc: add automatic session key exchange") allows a session
key to be securely exchanged between nodes as needed.

- Patch 4 ("tipc: add automatic rekeying for encryption key") adds
automatic 'rekeying' of session keys a specific interval. The new key
will be distributed automatically to peer nodes, so become active then.
The rekeying interval is configurable via netlink as well.

v2: update the "tipc: add automatic session key exchange" patch to fix
"implicit declaration" issue when built without "CONFIG_TIPC_CRYPTO".

v3: update the patches according to David comments by using the
"genl_info->extack" for messages in response to netlink user config
requests.
