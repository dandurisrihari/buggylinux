Full commit message:
Merge tag 'for-linus' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/virt/kvm/kvm

Pull KVM changes from Paolo Bonzini:
 "These are the x86, MIPS and s390 changes; PPC and ARM will come in a
  few days.

  MIPS and s390 have little going on this release; just bugfixes, some
  small, some larger.

  The highlights for x86 are nested VMX improvements (Jan Kiszka),
  optimizations for old processor (up to Nehalem, by me and Bandan Das),
  and a lot of x86 emulator bugfixes (Nadav Amit).

  Stephen Rothwell reported a trivial conflict with the tracing branch"
