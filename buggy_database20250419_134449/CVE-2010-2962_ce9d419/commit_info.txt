CVE Identifiers:
- CVE-2010-2962

Full commit message:
drm/i915: Sanity check pread/pwrite

Move the access control up from the fast paths, which are no longer
universally taken first, up into the caller. This then duplicates some
sanity checking along the slow paths, but is much simpler.
Tracked as CVE-2010-2962.
