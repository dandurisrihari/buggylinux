    arm64: KVM: Report SMCCC_ARCH_WORKAROUND_1 BP hardening support
    
    A new feature of SMCCC 1.1 is that it offers firmware-based CPU
    workarounds. In particular, SMCCC_ARCH_WORKAROUND_1 provides
    BP hardening for CVE-2017-5715.
    
    If the host has some mitigation for this issue, report that
    we deal with it using SMCCC_ARCH_WORKAROUND_1, as we apply the
    host workaround on every guest exit.
