Full commit message:
Merge tag 'kvmarm-6.7' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/kvmarm/kvmarm into HEAD

KVM/arm64 updates for 6.7

 - Generalized infrastructure for 'writable' ID registers, effectively
   allowing userspace to opt-out of certain vCPU features for its guest

 - Optimization for vSGI injection, opportunistically compressing MPIDR
   to vCPU mapping into a table

 - Improvements to KVM's PMU emulation, allowing userspace to select
   the number of PMCs available to a VM

 - Guest support for memory operation instructions (FEAT_MOPS)

 - Cleanups to handling feature flags in KVM_ARM_VCPU_INIT, squashing
   bugs and getting rid of useless code

 - Changes to the way the SMCCC filter is constructed, avoiding wasted
   memory allocations when not in use

 - Load the stage-2 MMU context at vcpu_load() for VHE systems, reducing
   the overhead of errata mitigations

 - Miscellaneous kernel and selftest fixes
