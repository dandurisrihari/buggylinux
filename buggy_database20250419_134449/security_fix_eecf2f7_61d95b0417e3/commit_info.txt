Full commit message:
ACPI, APEI, Add apei_exec_run_optional

Some actions in APEI ERST and EINJ tables are optional, for example,
ACPI_EINJ_BEGIN_OPERATION action is used to do some preparation for
error injection, and firmware may choose to do nothing here.  While
some other actions are mandatory, for example, firmware must provide
ACPI_EINJ_GET_ERROR_TYPE implementation.

Original implementation treats all actions as optional (that is, can
have no instructions), that may cause issue if firmware does not
provide some mandatory actions.  To fix this, this patch adds
apei_exec_run_optional, which should be used for optional actions.
The original apei_exec_run should be used for mandatory actions.
