    IIO: 1st set of fixes for the 6.8 cycle
    
    Usual mixed bag of issues introduced this cycle and fixes for long term
    issues that have been identified recently + one case where I messed up
    a merge resolution and dropped the build file changes.
    
    Most important is the userspace ABI fix for the iio_modifier enum
    where we accidentally added new entries in the middle rather than at
    the end.
    
    IIO Core
     - Close a memory leak in an error path.
     - Move LIGHT_UVA and LIGHT_UVB definitions to end of the iio_modifier
       enum to avoid breaking older userspace. (not yet in a released kernel
       thankfully).
    
    adi,adis
     - Fix a DMA buffer alignment issue that was missing in series that fixed
       these across IIO.
    
    adi,ad-sigma-delta
     - Fix a DMA buffer alignment issue that was missing in series that fixed
       these across IIO.
    
    adi,ad4130
     - Zero init remaining fields of clock init data.
     - Only set GPIO control bits on pins that aren't in use for anything else.
    
    adi,ad5933
     - Fix an old bug due to type mismatch. This is a rare device so good to
       get some new test coverage.
    
    adi,ad7091r
     - Use right variable for an error return code.
    
    bosch,bma400
     - Add missing CONFIG_REGMAP_I2C dependency.
    
    bosch,bmp280:
     - Add missing bmp085 ID to the SPI table to avoid mismatch with the
       of_device_id table.
    
    hid-sensors:
     - Avoid returning an error for timestamp read back that succeeds.
    
    pni,rm3100
     - Check value read from RM31000_REG_TMRC register is valid before using
       it. Hardening  to avoid a real world issue seen on some faulty hardware.
    
    st,st-sensors
     - Fix a DMA buffer alignment issue that was missing in series that fixed
       these across IIO.
    
    ti,hdc3020
     - Add missing Kconfig and Makefile entrees accidentally dropped when patches
       were applied.
     - Fix wrong temperature offset (negated)
