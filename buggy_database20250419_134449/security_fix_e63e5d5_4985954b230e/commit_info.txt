Full commit message:
x86/fpu: Introduce validate_xstate_header()

Move validation of user-supplied xstate_header into a helper function,
in preparation of calling it from both the ptrace and sigreturn syscall
paths.

The new function also considers it to be an error if *any* reserved bits
are set, whereas before we were just clearing most of them silently.

This should reduce the chance of bugs that fail to correctly validate
user-supplied XSAVE areas.  It also will expose any broken userspace
programs that set the other reserved bits; this is desirable because
such programs will lose compatibility with future CPUs and kernels if
those bits are ever used for anything.  (There shouldn't be any such
programs, and in fact in the case where the compacted format is in use
we were already validating xfeatures.  But you never know...)
