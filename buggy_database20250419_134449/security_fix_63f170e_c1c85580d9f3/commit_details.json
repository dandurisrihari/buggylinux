That can lead to\nconfusing behaviour like rejecting scans while\nauthenticated to any AP (but not yet associated.)\nIt also means that it needs to keep track of the\nwork struct while associated for when it gets\ndisassociated (or disassociates.)\n\nChange this to free the work struct after the\nauthentication completed successfully and\nallocate a new one for associating, thereby\nletting cfg80211 manage the auth state. Another\nchange necessary for this is to tell cfg80211\nabout all unicast deauth frames sent to mac80211\nsince now it can no longer check the auth state,\nbut that check was racy anyway.\n\nSigned-off-by: Johannes Berg <johannes@sipsolutions.net>\nSigned-off-by: John W.
