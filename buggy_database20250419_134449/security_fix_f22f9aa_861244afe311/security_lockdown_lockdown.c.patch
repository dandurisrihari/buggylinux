    selinux: remove the runtime disable functionality
    
    After working with the larger SELinux-based distros for several
    years, we're finally at a place where we can disable the SELinux
    runtime disable functionality.  The existing kernel deprecation
    notice explains the functionality and why we want to remove it:
    
      The selinuxfs "disable" node allows SELinux to be disabled at
      runtime prior to a policy being loaded into the kernel.  If
      disabled via this mechanism, SELinux will remain disabled until
      the system is rebooted.
    
      The preferred method of disabling SELinux is via the "selinux=0"
      boot parameter, but the selinuxfs "disable" node was created to
      make it easier for systems with primitive bootloaders that did not
      allow for easy modification of the kernel command line.
      Unfortunately, allowing for SELinux to be disabled at runtime makes
      it difficult to secure the kernel's LSM hooks using the
      "__ro_after_init" feature.
    
    It is that last sentence, mentioning the '__ro_after_init' hardening,
    which is the real motivation for this change, and if you look at the
    diffstat you'll see that the impact of this patch reaches across all
    the different LSMs, helping prevent tampering at the LSM hook level.
    
    From a SELinux perspective, it is important to note that if you
    continue to disable SELinux via "/etc/selinux/config" it may appear
    that SELinux is disabled, but it is simply in an uninitialized state.
    If you load a policy with `load_policy -i`, you will see SELinux
    come alive just as if you had loaded the policy during early-boot.
    
    It is also worth noting that the "/sys/fs/selinux/disable" file is
    always writable now, regardless of the Kconfig settings, but writing
    to the file has no effect on the system, other than to display an
    error on the console if a non-zero/true value is written.
    
    Finally, in the several years where we have been working on
    deprecating this functionality, there has only been one instance of
    someone mentioning any user visible breakage.  In this particular
    case it was an individual's kernel test system, and the workaround
    documented in the deprecation notice ("selinux=0" on the kernel
    command line) resolved the issue without problem.
