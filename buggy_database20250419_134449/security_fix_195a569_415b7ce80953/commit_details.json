  "body": "The failslab fault injection mechanism has an undocumented capability\nthat provides significant utility in testing and debugging. This feature,\nintroduced in commit 4c13dd3b48fcb (\"failslab: add ability to filter slab\ncaches\"), allows for targeted error injection into specific slab caches.\n\nHowever, it was inadvertently left undocumented at the time of its\nimplementation.\n\nAdd documentation for the cache-filter feature in the failslab mode\ndescription. Also, providing a practical example demonstrating how to\nuse cache-filter to inject failures specifically when allocating socket\nbuffers (skbs).\n\nSigned-off-by: Breno Leitao <leitao@debian.org>\nReviewed-by: Akinobu Mita <akinobu.mita@gmail.com>\nSigned-off-by: Jonathan Corbet <corbet@lwn.net>\nLink: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20240726120930.3231333-1-leitao@debian.org",
