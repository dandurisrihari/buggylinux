    cfg80211: Add nl80211 event for deletion of a station entry
    
    Indicate an NL80211_CMD_DEL_STATION event when a station entry in
    mac80211 is deleted to match with the NL80211_CMD_NEW_STATION event
    that is used when the entry was added. This is needed, e.g., to allow
    user space to remove a peer from RSN IBSS Authenticator state machine
    to avoid re-authentication and re-keying delays when the peer is not
    reachable anymore.
