Increase\nthe MTU on the external CPU port to account for the length of the\ninjection header.\n\nWithout this patch, MTU-sized frames are dropped by the switch's CPU\nport on xmit, which is especially obvious in TCP sessions.\n\nSigned-off-by: Vladimir Oltean <vladimir.oltean@nxp.com>\nReviewed-by: Andrew Lunn <andrew@lunn.ch>\nReviewed-by: Florian Fainelli <f.fainelli@gmail.com>\nSigned-off-by: David S.
