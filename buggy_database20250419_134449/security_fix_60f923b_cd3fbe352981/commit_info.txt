Full commit message:
hpsa: propagate return value from board ID lookup

If the board ID lookup function fails, return the return
code rather than return -ENODEV.

The only board ID failure reason right now is -ENODEV,
so this just provides more informative prints in kdump
and adapts to future changes.

Tested with error injection while booting with
	reset_devices
on the kernel command line:
[   62.804324]  injecting error in inj_hpsa_lookup_board_id: 1 11
[   62.804423] hpsa 0000:04:00.0: Board ID not found

(the pci probe layer does not print an additional
message if -ENODEV is the reason)
