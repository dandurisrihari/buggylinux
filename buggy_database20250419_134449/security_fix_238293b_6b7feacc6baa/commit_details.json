  "body": "PER events can always co-exist with other program interrupts.\n\nFor now, we always overwrite all program interrupt parameters when\ninjecting any type of program interrupt.\n\nLet's handle that correctly by only overwriting the relevant portion of\nthe program interrupt parameters. Therefore we can now inject PER events\nand ordinary program interrupts concurrently, resulting in no loss of\nprogram interrupts. This will especially by helpful when manually detecting\nPER events later - as both types might be triggered during one SIE exit.\n\nReviewed-by: Christian Borntraeger <borntraeger@de.ibm.com>\nSigned-off-by: David Hildenbrand <dahi@linux.vnet.ibm.com>\nSigned-off-by: Christian Borntraeger <borntraeger@de.ibm.com>",
