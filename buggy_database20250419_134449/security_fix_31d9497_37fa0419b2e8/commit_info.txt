Merge tag 'xfs-5.17-merge-6' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/fs/xfs/xfs-linux

Pull more xfs irix ioctl housecleaning from Darrick Wong:
 "Withdraw the XFS_IOC_ALLOCSP* and XFS_IOC_FREESP* ioctl definitions.

  This is the third and final of a series of small pull requests that
  perform some long overdue housecleaning of XFS ioctls. This time,
  we're withdrawing all variants of the ALLOCSP and FREESP ioctls from
  XFS' userspace API. This might be a little premature since we've only
  just removed the functionality, but as I pointed out in the last pull
  request, nobody (including fstests) noticed that it was broken for 20
  years.

  In response to the patch, we received a single comment from someone
  who stated that they 'augment' the ioctl for their own purposes, but
  otherwise acquiesced to the withdrawal. I still want to try to clobber
  these old ioctl definitions in 5.17.

  So remove the header definitions for these ioctls. The just-removed
  implementation has allowed callers to read stale disk contents for
  more than **21 years** and nobody noticed or complained, which implies
  a lack of users aside from exploit programs"
