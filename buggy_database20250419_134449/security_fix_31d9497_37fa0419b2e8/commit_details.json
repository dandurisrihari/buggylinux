This might be a little premature since we've only\n  just removed the functionality, but as I pointed out in the last pull\n  request, nobody (including fstests) noticed that it was broken for 20\n  years.\n\n  In response to the patch, we received a single comment from someone\n  who stated that they 'augment' the ioctl for their own purposes, but\n  otherwise acquiesced to the withdrawal. I still want to try to clobber\n  these old ioctl definitions in 5.17.\n\n  So remove the header definitions for these ioctls. The just-removed\n  implementation has allowed callers to read stale disk contents for\n  more than **21 years** and nobody noticed or complained, which implies\n  a lack of users aside from exploit programs\"\n\n* tag 'xfs-5.17-merge-6' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/fs/xfs/xfs-linux:\n  xfs: remove the XFS_IOC_{ALLOC,FREE}SP* definitions",
