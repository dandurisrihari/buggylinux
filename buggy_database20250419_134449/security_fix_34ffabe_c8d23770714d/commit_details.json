  "body": "The 'prefault_disable' modparam was used by IGT to prevent a few\nprefaulting operations to make fault handling under struct_mutex more\nprominent. With the removal of struct_mutex, this is not as important\nany more and we have almost completely stopped using the parameter. The\nremaining use in execbuf is now immaterial and can be dropped without\naffecting coverage.\n\nWe must re-address the idea of fault injection though.\n\nSigned-off-by: Chris Wilson <chris@chris-wilson.co.uk>\nCc: Antonio Argenziano <antonio.argenziano@intel.com>\nCc: Joonas Lahtinen <joonas.lahtinen@linux.intel.com>\nAcked-by: Jani Nikula <jani.nikula@intel.com>\nLink: https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/msgid/20200124230656.687503-1-chris@chris-wilson.co.uk",
