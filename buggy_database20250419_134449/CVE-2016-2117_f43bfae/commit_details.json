This bug was originally harmless since the\ndriver does not claim to implement checksum offload and that used to\nbe a requirement for SG.\n\nNow that SG and checksum offload are independent features, if you\nexplicitly enable SG *and* use one of the rare protocols that can use\nSG without checkusm offload, this potentially leaks sensitive\ninformation (before you notice that it just isn't working).
