    KVM: x86: Rename "governed features" helpers to use "guest_cpu_cap"
    
    As the first step toward replacing KVM's so-called "governed features"
    framework with a more comprehensive, less poorly named implementation,
    replace the "kvm_governed_feature" function prefix with "guest_cpu_cap"
    and rename guest_can_use() to guest_cpu_cap_has().
    
    The "guest_cpu_cap" naming scheme mirrors that of "kvm_cpu_cap", and
    provides a more clear distinction between guest capabilities, which are
    KVM controlled (heh, or one might say "governed"), and guest CPUID, which
    with few exceptions is fully userspace controlled.
    
    Opportunistically rewrite the comment about XSS passthrough for SEV-ES
    guests to avoid referencing so many functions, as such comments are prone
    to becoming stale (case in point...).
    
    No functional change intended.
