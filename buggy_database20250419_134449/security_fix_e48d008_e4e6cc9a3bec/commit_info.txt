Full commit message:
x86/mce/inject: Check if a bank is populated before injecting

The MCA_IPID register uniquely identifies a bank's type on Scalable MCA
(SMCA) systems. When an MCA bank is not populated, the MCA_IPID register
will read as zero and writes to it will be ignored.

On a hw-type error injection (injection which writes the actual MCA
registers in an attempt to cause a real MCE) check the value of this
register before trying to inject the error.

Do not impose any limitations on a sw injection and allow the user to
test out all the decoding paths without relying on the available hardware,
as its purpose is to just test the code.
