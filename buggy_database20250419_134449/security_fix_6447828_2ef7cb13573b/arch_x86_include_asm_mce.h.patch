    x86/mce/inject: Remove call to mce_notify_irq()
    
    The call to mce_notify_irq() has been there since the initial version of
    the soft inject mce machinery, introduced in
    
      ea149b36c7f5 ("x86, mce: add basic error injection infrastructure").
    
    At that time it was functional since injecting an MCE resulted in the
    following call chain:
    
      raise_mce()
        ->machine_check_poll()
            ->mce_log() - sets notfiy_user_bit
      ->mce_notify_user() (current mce_notify_irq) consumed the bit and called the
      usermode helper.
    
    However, with the introduction of
    
      011d82611172 ("RAS: Add a Corrected Errors Collector")
    
    the code got moved around and the usermode helper began to be called via the
    early notifier mce_first_notifier() rendering the call in raise_local()
    defunct as the mce_need_notify bit (ex notify_user) is only being set from the
    early notifier.
    
    Remove the noop call and make mce_notify_irq() static.
    
    No functional changes.
