    pinctrl: aspeed: Fix GPIO requests on pass-through banks
    
    Commit 6726fbff19bf ("pinctrl: aspeed: Fix GPI only function problem.")
    fixes access to GPIO banks T and U on the AST2600. Both banks contain
    input-only pins and the GPIO pin function is named GPITx and GPIUx
    respectively. Unfortunately the fix had a negative impact on GPIO banks
    D and E for the AST2400 and AST2500 where the GPIO pass-through
    functions take similar "GPI"-style names. The net effect on the older
    SoCs was that when the GPIO subsystem requested a pin in banks D or E be
    muxed for GPIO, they were instead muxed for pass-through mode.
    Mistakenly muxing pass-through mode e.g. breaks booting the host on
    IBM's Witherspoon (AC922) platform where GPIOE0 is used for FSI.
    
    Further exploit the names in the provided expression structure to
    differentiate pass-through from pin-specific GPIO modes.
    
    This follow-up fix gives the expected behaviour for the following tests:
    
    Witherspoon BMC (AST2500):
    
    1. Power-on the Witherspoon host
    2. Request GPIOD1 be muxed via /sys/class/gpio/export
    3. Request GPIOE1 be muxed via /sys/class/gpio/export
    4. Request the balls for GPIOs E2 and E3 be muxed as GPIO pass-through
       ("GPIE2" mode) via a pinctrl hog in the devicetree
    
    Rainier BMC (AST2600):
    
    5. Request GPIT0 be muxed via /sys/class/gpio/export
    6. Request GPIU0 be muxed via /sys/class/gpio/export
    
    Together the tests demonstrate that all three pieces of functionality
    (general GPIOs via 1, 2 and 3, input-only GPIOs via 5 and 6, pass-through
    mode via 4) operate as desired across old and new SoCs.

-	 * The signal type is GPIO if the signal name has "GPI" as a prefix.
-	 * strncmp (rather than strcmp) is used to implement the prefix
-	 * requirement.
+	 * We need to differentiate between GPIO and non-GPIO signals to
+	 * implement the gpio_request_enable() interface. For better or worse
+	 * the ASPEED pinctrl driver uses the expression names to determine
+	 * whether an expression will mux a pin for GPIO.
 	 *
-	 * expr->signal might look like "GPIOB1" in the GPIO case.
-	 * expr->signal might look like "GPIT0" in the GPI case.
+	 * Generally we have the following - A GPIO such as B1 has:
+	 *
+	 *    - expr->signal set to "GPIOB1"
+	 *    - expr->function set to "GPIOB1"
+	 *
+	 * Using this fact we can determine whether the provided expression is
+	 * a GPIO expression by testing the signal name for the string prefix
+	 * "GPIO".
+	 *
+	 * However, some GPIOs are input-only, and the ASPEED datasheets name
+	 * them differently. An input-only GPIO such as T0 has:
+	 *
+	 *    - expr->signal set to "GPIT0"
+	 *    - expr->function set to "GPIT0"
+	 *
+	 * It's tempting to generalise the prefix test from "GPIO" to "GPI" to
+	 * account for both GPIOs and GPIs, but in doing so we run aground on
+	 * another feature:
+	 *
+	 * Some pins in the ASPEED BMC SoCs have a "pass-through" GPIO
+	 * function where the input state of one pin is replicated as the
+	 * output state of another (as if they were shorted together - a mux
+	 * configuration that is typically enabled by hardware strapping).
+	 * This feature allows the BMC to pass e.g. power button state through
+	 * to the host while the BMC is yet to boot, but take control of the
+	 * button state once the BMC has booted by muxing each pin as a
+	 * separate, pin-specific GPIO.
+	 *
+	 * Conceptually this pass-through mode is a form of GPIO and is named
+	 * as such in the datasheets, e.g. "GPID0". This naming similarity
+	 * trips us up with the simple GPI-prefixed-signal-name scheme
+	 * discussed above, as the pass-through configuration is not what we
+	 * want when muxing a pin as GPIO for the GPIO subsystem.
+	 *
+	 * On e.g. the AST2400, a pass-through function "GPID0" is grouped on
+	 * balls A18 and D16, where we have:
+	 *
+	 *    For ball A18:
+	 *    - expr->signal set to "GPID0IN"
+	 *    - expr->function set to "GPID0"
+	 *
+	 *    For ball D16:
+	 *    - expr->signal set to "GPID0OUT"
+	 *    - expr->function set to "GPID0"
+	 *
+	 * By contrast, the pin-specific GPIO expressions for the same pins are
+	 * as follows:
+	 *
+	 *    For ball A18:
+	 *    - expr->signal looks like "GPIOD0"
+	 *    - expr->function looks like "GPIOD0"
+	 *
+	 *    For ball D16:
+	 *    - expr->signal looks like "GPIOD1"
+	 *    - expr->function looks like "GPIOD1"
+	 *
+	 * Testing both the signal _and_ function names gives us the means
+	 * differentiate the pass-through GPIO pinmux configuration from the
+	 * pin-specific configuration that the GPIO subsystem is after: An
+	 * expression is a pin-specific (non-pass-through) GPIO configuration
+	 * if the signal prefix is "GPI" and the signal name matches the
+	 * function name.
