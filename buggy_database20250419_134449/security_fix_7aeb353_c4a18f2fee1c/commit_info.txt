Full commit message:
pinctrl: aspeed: Fix GPIO requests on pass-through banks

Commit 6726fbff19bf ("pinctrl: aspeed: Fix GPI only function problem.")
fixes access to GPIO banks T and U on the AST2600. Both banks contain
input-only pins and the GPIO pin function is named GPITx and GPIUx
respectively. Unfortunately the fix had a negative impact on GPIO banks
D and E for the AST2400 and AST2500 where the GPIO pass-through
functions take similar "GPI"-style names. The net effect on the older
SoCs was that when the GPIO subsystem requested a pin in banks D or E be
muxed for GPIO, they were instead muxed for pass-through mode.
Mistakenly muxing pass-through mode e.g. breaks booting the host on
IBM's Witherspoon (AC922) platform where GPIOE0 is used for FSI.

Further exploit the names in the provided expression structure to
differentiate pass-through from pin-specific GPIO modes.

This follow-up fix gives the expected behaviour for the following tests:

Witherspoon BMC (AST2500):

1. Power-on the Witherspoon host
2. Request GPIOD1 be muxed via /sys/class/gpio/export
3. Request GPIOE1 be muxed via /sys/class/gpio/export
4. Request the balls for GPIOs E2 and E3 be muxed as GPIO pass-through
   ("GPIE2" mode) via a pinctrl hog in the devicetree

Rainier BMC (AST2600):

5. Request GPIT0 be muxed via /sys/class/gpio/export
6. Request GPIU0 be muxed via /sys/class/gpio/export

Together the tests demonstrate that all three pieces of functionality
(general GPIOs via 1, 2 and 3, input-only GPIOs via 5 and 6, pass-through
mode via 4) operate as desired across old and new SoCs.
