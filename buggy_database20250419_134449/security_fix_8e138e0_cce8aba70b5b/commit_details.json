While auditing the write out path I noticed that\nif we've already setup the space cache we will just carry on.  This\nmeans that any error we hit after cache_save_setup before we go to\nactually write the cache out we won't reset the inode generation, so\nwhatever was already written will be considered correct, except it'll be\nstale.  Fix this by _always_ resetting the generation on the block group\ninode, this way we only ever have valid or invalid cache.\n\nWith this patch I was no longer able to reproduce cache corruption with\ndm-log-writes and my bpf error injection tool.\n\nCc: stable@vger.kernel.org\nSigned-off-by: Josef Bacik <jbacik@fb.com>\nSigned-off-by: David Sterba <dsterba@suse.com>",
