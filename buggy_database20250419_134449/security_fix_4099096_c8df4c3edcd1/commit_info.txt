Full commit message:
wifi: ath6kl: replace deprecated strncpy with memcpy

strncpy() is deprecated for use on NUL-terminated destination strings
[1] and as such we should prefer more robust and less ambiguous
interfaces.

The affected code's purpose is to truncate strings that are too long
with "..." like:
foobar -> fo...

The lengths have been carefully calculated and as such this has decayed
to a simple byte copy from one buffer to another -- let's use memcpy().

Note: build-tested only.
