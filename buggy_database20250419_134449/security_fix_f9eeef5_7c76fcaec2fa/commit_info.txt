Full commit message:
fault-injection: make stacktrace filter works as expected

stacktrace filter is checked after others, such as fail-nth, interval and
probability.  This make it doesn't work well as expected.

Fix to running stacktrace filter before other filters.  It will speed up
fault inject testing for driver modules.
