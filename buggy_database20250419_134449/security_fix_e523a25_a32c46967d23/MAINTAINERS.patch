    Pull networking fixes from David Miller:
    
     1) Various sockmap fixes from John Fastabend (pinned map handling,
        blocking in recvmsg, double page put, error handling during redirect
        failures, etc.)
    
     2) Fix dead code handling in x86-64 JIT, from Gianluca Borello.
    
     3) Missing device put in RDS IB code, from Dag Moxnes.
    
     4) Don't process fast open during repair mode in TCP< from Yuchung
        Cheng.
    
     5) Move address/port comparison fixes in SCTP, from Xin Long.
    
     6) Handle add a bond slave's master into a bridge properly, from
        Hangbin Liu.
    
     7) IPv6 multipath code can operate on unitialized memory due to an
        assumption that the icmp header is in the linear SKB area. Fix from
        Eric Dumazet.
    
     8) Don't invoke do_tcp_sendpages() recursively via TLS, from Dave
        Watson.
    
    9) Fix memory leaks in x86-64 JIT, from Daniel Borkmann.
    
    10) RDS leaks kernel memory to userspace, from Eric Dumazet.
    
    11) DCCP can invoke a tasklet on a freed socket, take a refcount. Also
        from Eric Dumazet.
