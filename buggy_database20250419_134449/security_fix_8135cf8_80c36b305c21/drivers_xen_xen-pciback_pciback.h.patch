    xen/pciback: Save xen_pci_op commands before processing it
    
    Double fetch vulnerabilities that happen when a variable is
    fetched twice from shared memory but a security check is only
    performed the first time.
    
    The xen_pcibk_do_op function performs a switch statements on the op->cmd
    value which is stored in shared memory. Interestingly this can result
    in a double fetch vulnerability depending on the performed compiler
    optimization.
    
    This patch fixes it by saving the xen_pci_op command before
    processing it. We also use 'barrier' to make sure that the
    compiler does not perform any optimization.
    
    This is part of XSA155.
