KVM: powerpc: Move vector to irqprio resolving to separate function

We're using a switch table to find the irqprio that belongs to a specific
interrupt vector. This table is part of the interrupt inject logic.

Since we'll add a new function to stop interrupts, let's move this table
out of the injection logic into a separate function.
