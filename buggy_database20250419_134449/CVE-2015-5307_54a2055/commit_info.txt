Full commit message:
KVM: x86: work around infinite loop in microcode when #AC is delivered

It was found that a guest can DoS a host by triggering an infinite
stream of "alignment check" (#AC) exceptions.  This causes the
microcode to enter an infinite loop where the core never receives
another interrupt.  The host kernel panics pretty quickly due to the
effects (CVE-2015-5307).
