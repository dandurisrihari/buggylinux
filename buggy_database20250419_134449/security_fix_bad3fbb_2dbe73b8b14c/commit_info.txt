Full commit message:
docs: fault-injection: fix defaults

ignore-gfp-wait and ignore-gfp-highmem defaults are actually true (Y) in
both failslab and fail_page_alloc, not false as the docs suggest. See
page_alloc.c:3762 and failslab.c:13

At the same time use 'Y' instead of '1' in the example scripts just for
consistency. (though 1 would work)
