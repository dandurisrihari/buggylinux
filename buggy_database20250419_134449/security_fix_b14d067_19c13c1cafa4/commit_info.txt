Full commit message:
xfs: quiet notify_failure EOPNOTSUPP cases

Patch series "mm, xfs, dax: Fixes for memory_failure() handling".

I failed to run the memory error injection section of the ndctl test suite
on linux-next prior to the merge window and as a result some bugs were
missed.  While the new enabling targeted reflink enabled XFS filesystems
the bugs cropped up in the surrounding cases of DAX error injection on
ext4-fsdax and device-dax.

One new assumption / clarification in this set is the notion that if a
filesystem's ->notify_failure() handler returns -EOPNOTSUPP, then it must
be the case that the fsdax usage of page->index and page->mapping are
valid.  I am fairly certain this is true for xfs_dax_notify_failure(), but
would appreciate another set of eyes.


This patch (of 4):

XFS always registers dax_holder_operations regardless of whether the
filesystem is capable of handling the notifications.  The expectation is
that if the notify_failure handler cannot run then there are no scenarios
where it needs to run.  In other words the expected semantic is that
page->index and page->mapping are valid for memory_failure() when the
conditions that cause -EOPNOTSUPP in xfs_dax_notify_failure() are present.

A fallback to the generic memory_failure() path is expected so do not warn
when that happens.
