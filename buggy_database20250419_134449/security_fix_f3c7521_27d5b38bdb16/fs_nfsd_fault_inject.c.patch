    NFSD: Fold fault_inject.h into state.h
    
    There were only a small number of functions in this file and since they
    all affect stored state I think it makes sense to put them in state.h
    instead.  I also dropped most static inline declarations since there are
    no callers when fault injection is not enabled.
