Full commit message:
Merge tag 'trace-v6.1-1' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/trace/linux-trace

Pull tracing fixes from Steven Rostedt:

 - Found that the synthetic events were using strlen/strscpy() on values
   that could have come from userspace, and that is bad.

   Consolidate the string logic of kprobe and eprobe and extend it to
   the synthetic events to safely process string addresses.

 - Clean up content of text dump in ftrace_bug() where the output does
   not make char reads into signed and sign extending the byte output.

 - Fix some kernel docs in the ring buffer code.

* tag 'trace-v6.1-1' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/trace/linux-trace:

  ring-buffer: Fix kernel-doc
