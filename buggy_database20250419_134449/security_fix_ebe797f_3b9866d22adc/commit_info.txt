Full commit message:
virtio: VIRTIO_HARDEN_NOTIFICATION is broken

This option doesn't really work and breaks too many drivers.
Not yet sure what's the right thing to do, for now
let's make sure randconfig isn't broken by this.

Fixes: c346dae4f3fb ("virtio: disable notification hardening by default")
