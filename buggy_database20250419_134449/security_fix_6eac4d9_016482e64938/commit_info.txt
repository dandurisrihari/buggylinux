Full commit message:
KVM: x86: Add a macro to init CPUID features that are 64-bit only

Add a macro to mask-in feature flags that are supported only on 64-bit
kernels/KVM.  In addition to reducing overall #ifdeffery, using a macro
will allow hardening the kvm_cpu_cap initialization sequences to assert
that the features being advertised are indeed included in the word being
initialized.  And arguably using *F() macros through is more readable.

No functional change intended.
