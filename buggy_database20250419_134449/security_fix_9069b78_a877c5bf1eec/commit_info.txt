Full commit message:
Revert "drm/i915/gt: Log reason for setting TAINT_WARN at reset"

This reverts commit 835443da6f50d9516b58bba5a4fdf9e563d961c7.

Logging with gt_err() causes CI to detect an error even in cases
of intentional error injection. Since real errors are already
correctly reported by CI, this additional message is unnecessary.

Furthermore, a GT wedge is already being logged elsewhere, so
instead of adjusting the log level, revert the above mentioned
commit to prevent redundant error reporting.
