Full commit message:
lkdtm: Add CFI_BACKWARD to test ROP mitigations

In order to test various backward-edge control flow integrity methods,
add a test that manipulates the return address on the stack. Currently
only arm64 Pointer Authentication and Shadow Call Stack is supported.

 $ echo CFI_BACKWARD | cat >/sys/kernel/debug/provoke-crash/DIRECT

Under SCS, successful test of the mitigation is reported as:

 lkdtm: Performing direct entry CFI_BACKWARD
 lkdtm: Attempting unchecked stack return address redirection ...
 lkdtm: ok: redirected stack return address.
 lkdtm: Attempting checked stack return address redirection ...
 lkdtm: ok: control flow unchanged.

Under PAC, successful test of the mitigation is reported by the PAC
exception handler:

 lkdtm: Performing direct entry CFI_BACKWARD
 lkdtm: Attempting unchecked stack return address redirection ...
 lkdtm: ok: redirected stack return address.
 lkdtm: Attempting checked stack return address redirection ...
 Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address bfffffc0088d0514
 Mem abort info:
   ESR = 0x86000004
   EC = 0x21: IABT (current EL), IL = 32 bits
   SET = 0, FnV = 0
   EA = 0, S1PTW = 0
   FSC = 0x04: level 0 translation fault
 [bfffffc0088d0514] address between user and kernel address ranges
 ...

If the CONFIGs are missing (or the mitigation isn't working), failure
is reported as:

 lkdtm: Performing direct entry CFI_BACKWARD
 lkdtm: Attempting unchecked stack return address redirection ...
 lkdtm: ok: redirected stack return address.
 lkdtm: Attempting checked stack return address redirection ...
 lkdtm: FAIL: stack return address was redirected!
 lkdtm: This is probably expected, since this kernel was built *without* CONFIG_ARM64_PTR_AUTH_KERNEL=y nor CONFIG_SHADOW_CALL_STACK=y
