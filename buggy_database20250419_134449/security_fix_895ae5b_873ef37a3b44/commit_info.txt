Full commit message:
drivers: misc: Add Support for TMR Inject IP

The Triple Modular Redundancy(TMR) provides functional fault injection by
changing selected MicroBlaze instructions, which provides the possibility
to verify that the TMR subsystem error detection and fault recovery logic
is working properly.

Usage:
echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/xtmr_inject/inject_fault/inject_fault
