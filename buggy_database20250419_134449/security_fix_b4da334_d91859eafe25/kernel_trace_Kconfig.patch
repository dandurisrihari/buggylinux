    tracing/kprobe: bpf: Check error injectable event is on function entry
    
    Check whether error injectable event is on function entry or not.
    Currently it checks the event is ftrace-based kprobes or not,
    but that is wrong. It should check if the event is on the entry
    of target function. Since error injection will override a function
    to just return with modified return value, that operation must
    be done before the target function starts making stackframe.
    
    As a side effect, bpf error injection is no need to depend on
    function-tracer. It can work with sw-breakpoint based kprobe
    events too.
