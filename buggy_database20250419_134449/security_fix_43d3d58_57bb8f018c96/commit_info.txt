Pull drm fixes from Daniel Vetter:
 "Looks like people are back from the break, usual small pile of fixes
  all over. Next week Dave should be back.

  The only thing pending I'm aware of is a "this shouldn't have become
  uapi" reverts for amdgpu, but they're already on the list and not that
  important really so can wait another week.

  Summary:

   - fix for ttm list corruption in radeon, reported by a few people

   - fixes for amdgpu, i915, msm

   - dma-buf use-after free fix"
