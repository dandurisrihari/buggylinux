Full commit message:
virtchnl: do structure hardening

The virtchnl interface can have a bunch of "soft" defined structures
hardened by using explicit sizes for declarations, and then referring to
the enum type that uses them in a comment. None of these changes should
change any of the structure sizes.

Also, remove a duplicate line in a switch statement and let two cases
uses the same code.
