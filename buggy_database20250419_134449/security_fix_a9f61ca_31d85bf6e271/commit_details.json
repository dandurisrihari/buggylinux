  "body": "When we crash from NMI context (e.g. after NMI injection from host when\n'sysctl -w kernel.unknown_nmi_panic=1' is set) we hit\n\n    kernel BUG at mm/vmalloc.c:1530!\n\nas vfree() is denied. While the issue could be solved with in_nmi() check\ninstead I opted for skipping vfree on all sorts of crashes to reduce the\namount of work which can cause consequent crashes. We don't really need to\nfree anything on crash.\n\nSigned-off-by: Vitaly Kuznetsov <vkuznets@redhat.com>\nSigned-off-by: K. Y.
