Full commit message:
drm/amd/display: add event type check before restart the authentication

[Why]
Some combined docks will always trigger CP_IRQ but there's nothing the driver
needs to take care of, but the CP_IRQ breaks the original hdcp state and
triggers the driver to restart the authentication.

[How]
Add the event type check before restart the authentication or resend the stream
management
