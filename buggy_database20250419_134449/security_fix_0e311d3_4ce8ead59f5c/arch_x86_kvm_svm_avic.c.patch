    KVM: SVM: Introduce hybrid-AVIC mode
    
    Currently, AVIC is inhibited when booting a VM w/ x2APIC support.
    because AVIC cannot virtualize x2APIC MSR register accesses.
    However, the AVIC doorbell can be used to accelerate interrupt
    injection into a running vCPU, while all guest accesses to x2APIC MSRs
    will be intercepted and emulated by KVM.
    
    With hybrid-AVIC support, the APICV_INHIBIT_REASON_X2APIC is
    no longer enforced.
