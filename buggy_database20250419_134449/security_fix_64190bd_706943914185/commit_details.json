  "body": "The following restrictions affect clients connecting using legacy nodes:\n\n*) Masters that have dropped master privilieges are not considered\n   authenticated until they regain master privileges.\n*) Clients whose master have dropped master privileges block interruptibly on\n   ioctls  requiring authentication until their master regains master\n   privileges. If their master exits, they are killed.\n\nThis is primarily designed to prevent clients authenticated with one master to\naccess data from clients authenticated with another master.\n(Think fast user-switching or data sniffers enabled while X is vt-switched).\n\nSigned-off-by: Thomas Hellstrom <thellstrom@vmware.com>\nReviewed-by: Brian Paul <brianp@vmware.com>",
