Full commit message:
xen/efi: refactor deprecated strncpy

`strncpy` is deprecated for use on NUL-terminated destination strings [1].

`efi_loader_signature` has space for 4 bytes. We are copying "Xen" (3 bytes)
plus a NUL-byte which makes 4 total bytes. With that being said, there is
currently not a bug with the current `strncpy()` implementation in terms of
buffer overreads but we should favor a more robust string interface
either way.

A suitable replacement is `strscpy` [2] due to the fact that it guarantees
NUL-termination on the destination buffer while being functionally the
same in this case.
