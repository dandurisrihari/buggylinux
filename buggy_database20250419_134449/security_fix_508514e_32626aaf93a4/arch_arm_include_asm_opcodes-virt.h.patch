    ARM: 7511/1: opcodes: Opcode definitions for the Virtualization Extensions
    
    For now, this patch just adds a definition for the HVC instruction.
    More can be added here later, as needed.
    
    Now that we have a real example of how to use the opcode injection
    macros properly, this patch also adds a cross-reference from the
    explanation in opcodes.h (since without an example, figuring out
    how to use the macros is not that easy).
