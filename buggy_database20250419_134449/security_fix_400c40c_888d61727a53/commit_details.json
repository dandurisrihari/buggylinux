  "body": "This patch adds the AEAD support for AF_ALG.\n\nThe implementation is based on algif_skcipher, but contains heavy\nmodifications to streamline the interface for AEAD uses.\n\nTo use AEAD, the user space consumer has to use the salg_type named\n\"aead\".\n\nThe AEAD implementation includes some overhead to calculate the size of\nthe ciphertext, because the AEAD implementation of the kernel crypto API\nmakes implied assumption on the location of the authentication tag. When\nperforming an encryption, the tag will be added to the created\nciphertext (note, the tag is placed adjacent to the ciphertext). For\ndecryption, the caller must hand in the ciphertext with the tag appended\nto the ciphertext. Therefore, the selection of the used memory\nneeds to add/subtract the tag size from the source/destination buffers\ndepending on the encryption type. The code is provided with comments\nexplaining when and how that operation is performed.\n\nA fully working example using all aspects of AEAD is provided at\nhttp://www.chronox.de/libkcapi.html\n\nSigned-off-by: Stephan Mueller <smueller@chronox.de>\nSigned-off-by: Herbert Xu <herbert@gondor.apana.org.au>",
