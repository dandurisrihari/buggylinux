Subject: net sched actions: allocate act cookie early

CVE Identifiers:
- CVE-2017-7979

Full commit message:
net sched actions: allocate act cookie early

Policing filters do not use the TCA_ACT_* enum and the tb[]
nlattr array in tcf_action_init_1() doesn't get filled for
them so we should not try to look for a TCA_ACT_COOKIE
attribute in the then uninitialized array.
The error handling in cookie allocation then calls
tcf_hash_release() leading to invalid memory access later
on.
Additionally, if cookie allocation fails after an already
existing non-policing filter has successfully been changed,
tcf_action_release() should not be called, also we would
have to roll back the changes in the error handling, so
instead we now allocate the cookie early and assign it on
success at the end.
