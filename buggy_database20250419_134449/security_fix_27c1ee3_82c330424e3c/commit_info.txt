Full commit message:
Merge branch 'akpm' (Andrew's patch-bomb)

Merge Andrew's first set of patches:
 "Non-MM patches:

   - lots of misc bits

   - tree-wide have_clk() cleanups

   - quite a lot of printk tweaks.  I draw your attention to "printk:
     convert the format for KERN_<LEVEL> to a 2 byte pattern" which
     looks a bit scary.  But afaict it's solid.

   - backlight updates

   - lib/ feature work (notably the addition and use of memweight())

   - checkpatch updates

   - rtc updates

   - nilfs updates

   - fatfs updates (partial, still waiting for acks)

   - kdump, proc, fork, IPC, sysctl, taskstats, pps, etc

   - new fault-injection feature work"
