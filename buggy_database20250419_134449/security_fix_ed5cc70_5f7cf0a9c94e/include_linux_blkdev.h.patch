    block: Add config option to not allow writing to mounted devices
    
    Writing to mounted devices is dangerous and can lead to filesystem
    corruption as well as crashes. Furthermore syzbot comes with more and
    more involved examples how to corrupt block device under a mounted
    filesystem leading to kernel crashes and reports we can do nothing
    about. Add tracking of writers to each block device and a kernel cmdline
    argument which controls whether other writeable opens to block devices
    open with BLK_OPEN_RESTRICT_WRITES flag are allowed. We will make
    filesystems use this flag for used devices.
    
    Note that this effectively only prevents modification of the particular
    block device's page cache by other writers. The actual device content
    can still be modified by other means - e.g. by issuing direct scsi
    commands, by doing writes through devices lower in the storage stack
    (e.g. in case loop devices, DM, or MD are involved) etc. But blocking
    direct modifications of the block device page cache is enough to give
    filesystems a chance to perform data validation when loading data from
    the underlying storage and thus prevent kernel crashes.
    
    Syzbot can use this cmdline argument option to avoid uninteresting
    crashes. Also users whose userspace setup does not need writing to
    mounted block devices can set this option for hardening.
