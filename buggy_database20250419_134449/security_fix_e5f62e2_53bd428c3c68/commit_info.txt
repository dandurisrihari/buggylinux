Merge tag 'kvmarm-6.10-1' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/kvmarm/kvmarm into HEAD

KVM/arm64 updates for Linux 6.10

- Move a lot of state that was previously stored on a per vcpu
  basis into a per-CPU area, because it is only pertinent to the
  host while the vcpu is loaded. This results in better state
  tracking, and a smaller vcpu structure.

- Add full handling of the ERET/ERETAA/ERETAB instructions in
  nested virtualisation. The last two instructions also require
  emulating part of the pointer authentication extension.
  As a result, the trap handling of pointer authentication has
  been greattly simplified.

- Turn the global (and not very scalable) LPI translation cache
  into a per-ITS, scalable cache, making non directly injected
  LPIs much cheaper to make visible to the vcpu.

- A batch of pKVM patches, mostly fixes and cleanups, as the
  upstreaming process seems to be resuming. Fingers crossed!

- Allocate PPIs and SGIs outside of the vcpu structure, allowing
  for smaller EL2 mapping and some flexibility in implementing
  more or less than 32 private IRQs.

- Purge stale mpidr_data if a vcpu is created after the MPIDR
  map has been created.

- Preserve vcpu-specific ID registers across a vcpu reset.

- Various minor cleanups and improvements.
