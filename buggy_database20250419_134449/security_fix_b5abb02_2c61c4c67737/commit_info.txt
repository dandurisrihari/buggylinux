e1000: Fix DMA mapping error handling on RX

Check for error return from pci_map_single/pci_map_page and clean up.

With this and the previous patch the driver was able to handle a significant
percentage of errors (I set the fault injection rate to 10% and could still
download large files at a reasonable speed).
