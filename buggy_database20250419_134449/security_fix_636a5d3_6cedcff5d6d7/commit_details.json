  "body": "This patch adds new nl80211 commands to allow user space to request\nauthentication and association (and also deauthentication and\ndisassociation). The commands are structured to allow separate\nauthentication and association steps, i.e., the interface between\nkernel and user space is similar to the MLME SAP interface in IEEE\n802.11 standard and an user space application takes the role of the\nSME.\n\nThe patch introduces MLME-AUTHENTICATE.request,\nMLME-{,RE}ASSOCIATE.request, MLME-DEAUTHENTICATE.request, and\nMLME-DISASSOCIATE.request primitives. The authentication and\nassociation commands request the actual operations in two steps\n(assuming the driver supports this; if not, separate authentication\nstep is skipped; this could end up being a separate \"connect\"\ncommand).\n\nThe initial implementation for mac80211 uses the current\nnet/mac80211/mlme.c for actual sending and processing of management\nframes and the new nl80211 commands will just stop the current state\nmachine from moving automatically from authentication to association.\nFuture cleanup may move more of the MLME operations into cfg80211.\n\nThe goal of this design is to provide more control of authentication and\nassociation process to user space without having to move the full MLME\nimplementation. This should be enough to allow IEEE 802.11r FT protocol\nand 802.11s SAE authentication to be implemented. Obviously, this will\nalso bring the extra benefit of not having to use WEXT for association\nrequests with mac80211. An example implementation of a user space SME\nusing the new nl80211 commands is available for wpa_supplicant.\n\nThis patch is enough to get IEEE 802.11r FT protocol working with\nover-the-air mechanism (over-the-DS will need additional MLME\nprimitives for handling the FT Action frames).\n\nSigned-off-by: Jouni Malinen <j@w1.fi>\nSigned-off-by: John W.
