Full commit message:
init: replace deprecated strncpy with strscpy_pad

strncpy() is deprecated for use on NUL-terminated destination strings
[1] and as such we should prefer more robust and less ambiguous string
interfaces.

data_page wants to be NUL-terminated and NUL-padded, use strscpy_pad to
provide both of these. data_page no longer awkwardly relies on
init_mount to perform its NUL-termination, although that sanity check is
left unchanged.
