Full commit message:
USB: serial: cp210x: add Kamstrup RF sniffer PIDs

The RF sniffers are based on cp210x where the RF frontends
are based on a different USB stack.

RF sniffers can analyze packets meta data including power level
and perform packet injection.

Can be used to perform RF frontend self-test when connected to
a concentrator, ex. arch/arm/boot/dts/imx7d-flex-concentrator.dts
