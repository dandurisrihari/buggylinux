    scsi: qla2xxx: edif: Add key update
    
    Some FC adapters from Marvell offer the ability to encrypt data in flight
    (EDIF). This feature requires an application to act as an authenticator.
    
    As part of the authentication process, the authentication application will
    generate a SADB entry (Security Association/SA, key, SPI value, etc). This
    SADB is then passed to driver to be programmed into hardware. There will be
    a pair of SADB's (Tx and Rx) for each connection.
    
    After some period, the application can choose to change the key. At that
    time, a new set of SADB pair is given to driver. The old set of SADB will
    be deleted.
    
    Add a new bsg call (QL_VND_SC_SA_UPDATE) to allow application to allow
    adding or deleting SADB entries.  Driver will not keep the key in
    memory. It will pass it to HW.
    
    It is assumed that application will assign a unique SPI value to this SADB
    (SA + key). Driver + hardware will assign a handle to track this unique
    SPI/SADB.
