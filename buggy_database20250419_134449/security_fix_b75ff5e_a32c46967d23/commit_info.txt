Pull networking fixes from David Miller:

 1) If the local_df boolean is set on an SKB we have to allocate a
    unique ID even if IP_DF is set in the ipv4 headers, from Ansis
    Atteka.

 2) Some fixups for the new chipset support that went into the sfc
    driver, from Ben Hutchings.

 3) Because SCTP bypasses a good chunk of, and actually duplicates, the
    logic of the ipv6 output path, some IPSEC things don't get done
    properly.  Integrate SCTP better into the ipv6 output path so that
    these problems are fixed and such issues don't get missed in the
    future either.  From Daniel Borkmann.

 4) Fix skge regressions added by the DMA mapping error return checking
    added in v3.10, from Mikulas Patocka.

 5) Kill some more IRQF_DISABLED references, from Michael Opdenacker.

 6) Fix races and deadlocks in the bridging code, from Hong Zhiguo.

 7) Fix error handling in tun_set_iff(), in particular don't leak
    resources.  From Jason Wang.

 8) Prevent format-string injection into xen-netback driver, from Kees
    Cook.

 9) Fix regression added to netpoll ARP packet handling, in particular
    check for the right ETH_P_ARP protocol code.  From Sonic Zhang.

10) Try to deal with AMD IOMMU errors when using r8169 chips, from
    Francois Romieu.

11) Cure freezes due to recent changes in the rt2x00 wireless driver,
    from Stanislaw Gruszka.

12) Don't do SPI transfers (which can sleep) in interrupt context in
    cw1200 driver, from Solomon Peachy.

13) Fix LEDs handling bug in 5720 tg3 chips already handled for 5719.
    From Nithin Sujir.

14) Make xen_netbk_count_skb_slots() count the actual number of slots
    that will be used, taking into consideration packing and other
    issues that the transmit path will run into.  From David Vrabel.

15) Use the correct maximum age when calculating the bridge
    message_age_timer, from Chris Healy.

16) Get rid of memory leaks in mcs7780 IRDA driver, from Alexey
    Khoroshilov.

17) Netfilter conntrack extensions were converted to RCU but are not
    always freed properly using kfree_rcu().  Fix from Michal Kubecek.

18) VF reset recovery not being done correctly in qlcnic driver, from
    Manish Chopra.

19) Fix inverted test in ATM nicstar driver, from Andy Shevchenko.

20) Missing workqueue destroy in cxgb4 error handling, from Wei Yang.

21) Internal switch not initialized properly in bgmac driver, from Rafał
    Miłecki.

22) Netlink messages report wrong local and remote addresses in IPv6
    tunneling, from Ding Zhi.

23) ICMP redirects should not generate socket errors in DCCP and SCTP.
    We're still working out how this should be handled for RAW and UDP
    sockets.  From Daniel Borkmann and Duan Jiong.

24) We've had several bugs wherein the network namespace's loopback
    device gets accessed after it is free'd, NULL it out so that we can
    catch these problems more readily.  From Eric W Biederman.

25) Fix regression in TCP RTO calculations, from Neal Cardwell.

26) Fix too early free of xen-netback network device when VIFs still
    exist.  From Paul Durrant.
