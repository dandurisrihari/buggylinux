Linville says:\n\n====================\nFor now I have dropped the mac80211 tree from this request.\nWe are developing a little backlog of fixes and I would like to\navoid introducing any more uncertainty to this pull request for the\n3.10 stream.  All the other bits are the same as what was in the\n2013-06-06 request, including the ath9k fixes intended to address\nthe problems observed by Linus w/ his Pixel, and a CVE fix for a\npotential security issue in the b43 driver.\n\nRegarding the wl12xx bits, Luca says:\n\n\"Here are three patches that I'd like to get into 3.10.  Two of them, by\nme, are related to the firmware version checks in our driver.  Without\nthem, the firmwares fail to load.  The other one, by Eliad, fixes a typo\nbug in our 5GHz scanning code.\"\n\nAnd as for the Bluetooth bits, Gustavo says:\n\n\"The following patches are important bug fixes for 3.10, plus the\nsupport for a new device. We do have three fixes from Johan. The first\none is a fix to avoid LE-only devices to rely on the (inexistent)\nextended features data. The second patch fixes length checks on\nincoming L2CAP signalling PDUs so we can discard PDU whose size\ndoesn't match the one reported in the header.  The last one fixes\nthe handling of power on failures, we now report proper errors to\nmgmt when hci_dev_open().\"\n\nAlong with that...\n\nLarry Finger corrects an rtlwifi problem that caused some devices to\nrefuse to connect to non-WPA2 networks if the device had previously\nassocated with a WPA2 network.
