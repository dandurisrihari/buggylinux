    randstruct: Move seed generation into scripts/basic/
    
    To enable Clang randstruct support, move the structure layout
    randomization seed generation out of scripts/gcc-plugins/ into
    scripts/basic/ so it happens early enough that it can be used by either
    compiler implementation. The gcc-plugin still builds its own header file,
    but now does so from the common "randstruct.seed" file.
