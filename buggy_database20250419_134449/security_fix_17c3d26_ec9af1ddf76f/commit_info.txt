Full commit message:
block, bfq: increase update frequency of inject limit

The update period of the injection limit has been tentatively set to
100 ms, to reduce fluctuations. This value however proved to cause,
occasionally, the limit to be decremented for some bfq_queue only
after the queue underwent excessive injection for a lot of time. This
commit reduces the period to 10 ms.
