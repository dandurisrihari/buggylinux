Full commit message:
[IPSEC] esp: Remove keys from esp_data structure

The keys are only used during initialisation so we don't need to carry them
in esp_data.  Since we don't have to allocate them again, there is no need
to place a limit on the authentication key length anymore.

This patch also kills the unused auth.icv member.
