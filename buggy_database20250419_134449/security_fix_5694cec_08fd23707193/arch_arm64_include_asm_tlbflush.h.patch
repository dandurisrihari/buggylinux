    Merge tag 'arm64-upstream' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/arm64/linux
    
    Pull arm64 festive updates from Will Deacon:
     "In the end, we ended up with quite a lot more than I expected:
    
       - Support for ARMv8.3 Pointer Authentication in userspace (CRIU and
         kernel-side support to come later)
    
       - Support for per-thread stack canaries, pending an update to GCC
         that is currently undergoing review
    
       - Support for kexec_file_load(), which permits secure boot of a kexec
         payload but also happens to improve the performance of kexec
         dramatically because we can avoid the sucky purgatory code from
         userspace. Kdump will come later (requires updates to libfdt).
    
       - Optimisation of our dynamic CPU feature framework, so that all
         detected features are enabled via a single stop_machine()
         invocation
    
       - KPTI whitelisting of Cortex-A CPUs unaffected by Meltdown, so that
         they can benefit from global TLB entries when KASLR is not in use
    
       - 52-bit virtual addressing for userspace (kernel remains 48-bit)
    
       - Patch in LSE atomics for per-cpu atomic operations
    
       - Custom preempt.h implementation to avoid unconditional calls to
         preempt_schedule() from preempt_enable()
    
       - Support for the new 'SB' Speculation Barrier instruction
    
       - Vectorised implementation of XOR checksumming and CRC32
         optimisations
    
       - Workaround for Cortex-A76 erratum #1165522
    
       - Improved compatibility with Clang/LLD
    
       - Support for TX2 system PMUS for profiling the L3 cache and DMC
    
       - Reflect read-only permissions in the linear map by default
    
       - Ensure MMIO reads are ordered with subsequent calls to Xdelay()
    
       - Initial support for memory hotplug
    
       - Tweak the threshold when we invalidate the TLB by-ASID, so that
         mremap() performance is improved for ranges spanning multiple PMDs.
    
       - Minor refactoring and cleanups"
