Full commit message:
Merge tag 'slab-for-6.1-rc4-fixes' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/vbabka/slab

Pull slab fixes from Vlastimil Babka:
 "Most are small fixups as described below.

  The !CONFIG_TRACING fix is a bit bigger and would normally be done in
  the next merge window as part of upcoming hardening changes. But we
  realized it can make the kmalloc waste tracking introduced in this
  window inaccurate, so decided to go with it now.

  Summary:

   - Remove !CONFIG_TRACING kmalloc() wrappers intended to save a
     function call, due to incompatilibity with recently introduced
     wasted space tracking and planned hardening changes.

   - A tracing parameter regression fix, by Kees Cook.

   - Two kernel-doc warning fixups, by Lukas Bulwahn and myself
