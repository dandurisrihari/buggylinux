Full commit message:
drivers/misc/sgi-gru: fix Spectre v1 vulnerability

req.gid can be indirectly controlled by user-space, hence leading to
a potential exploitation of the Spectre variant 1 vulnerability.

This issue was detected with the help of Smatch:

vers/misc/sgi-gru/grukdump.c:200 gru_dump_chiplet_request() warn:
potential spectre issue 'gru_base' [w]

Fix this by sanitizing req.gid before calling macro GID_TO_GRU, which
uses it to index gru_base.

Notice that given that speculation windows are large, the policy is
to kill the speculation on the first load and not worry if it can be
completed with a dependent load/store [1].
