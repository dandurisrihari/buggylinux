    x86/xen: add central hypercall functions
    
    Add generic hypercall functions usable for all normal (i.e. not iret)
    hypercalls. Depending on the guest type and the processor vendor
    different functions need to be used due to the to be used instruction
    for entering the hypervisor:
    
    - PV guests need to use syscall
    - HVM/PVH guests on Intel need to use vmcall
    - HVM/PVH guests on AMD and Hygon need to use vmmcall
    
    As PVH guests need to issue hypercalls very early during boot, there
    is a 4th hypercall function needed for HVM/PVH which can be used on
    Intel and AMD processors. It will check the vendor type and then set
    the Intel or AMD specific function to use via static_call().
    
    This is part of XSA-466 / CVE-2024-53241.
