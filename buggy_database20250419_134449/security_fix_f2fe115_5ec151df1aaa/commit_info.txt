Full commit message:
crypto: aead - un-inline encrypt and decrypt functions

crypto_aead_encrypt() and crypto_aead_decrypt() have grown to be more
than a single indirect function call.  They now also check whether a key
has been set, the decryption side checks whether the input is at least
as long as the authentication tag length, and with CONFIG_CRYPTO_STATS=y
they also update the crypto statistics.  That can add up to a lot of
bloat at every call site.  Moreover, these always involve a function
call anyway, which greatly limits the benefits of inlining.

So change them to be non-inline.
