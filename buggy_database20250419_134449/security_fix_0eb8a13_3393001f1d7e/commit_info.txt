Full commit message:
cifs: add "multiuser" mount option

This allows someone to declare a mount as a multiuser mount.

Multiuser mounts also imply "noperm" since we want to allow the server
to handle permission checking. It also (for now) requires Kerberos
authentication. Eventually, we could expand this to other authtypes, but
that requires a scheme to allow per-user credential stashing in some
form.
