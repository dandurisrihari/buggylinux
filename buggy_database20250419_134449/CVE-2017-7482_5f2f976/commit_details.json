  "body": "This fixes CVE-2017-7482.\n\nWhen a kerberos 5 ticket is being decoded so that it can be loaded into an\nrxrpc-type key, there are several places in which the length of a\nvariable-length field is checked to make sure that it's not going to\noverrun the available data - but the data is padded to the nearest\nfour-byte boundary and the code doesn't check for this extra.  This could\nlead to the size-remaining variable wrapping and the data pointer going\nover the end of the buffer.\n\nFix this by making the various variable-length data checks use the padded\nlength.\n\nReported-by: \u77f3\u78ca <shilei-c@360.cn>\nSigned-off-by: David Howells <dhowells@redhat.com>\nReviewed-by: Marc Dionne <marc.c.dionne@auristor.com>\nReviewed-by: Dan Carpenter <dan.carpenter@oracle.com>\nSigned-off-by: David S.
