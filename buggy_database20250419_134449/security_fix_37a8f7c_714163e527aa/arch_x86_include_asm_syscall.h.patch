    x86/asm: Move 'status' from thread_struct to thread_info
    
    The TS_COMPAT bit is very hot and is accessed from code paths that mostly
    also touch thread_info::flags.  Move it into struct thread_info to improve
    cache locality.
    
    The only reason it was in thread_struct is that there was a brief period
    during which arch-specific fields were not allowed in struct thread_info.
    
    Linus suggested further changing:
    
      ti->status &= ~(TS_COMPAT|TS_I386_REGS_POKED);
    
    to:
    
      if (unlikely(ti->status & (TS_COMPAT|TS_I386_REGS_POKED)))
              ti->status &= ~(TS_COMPAT|TS_I386_REGS_POKED);
    
    on the theory that frequently dirtying the cacheline even in pure 64-bit
    code that never needs to modify status hurts performance.  That could be a
    reasonable followup patch, but I suspect it matters less on top of this
    patch.
