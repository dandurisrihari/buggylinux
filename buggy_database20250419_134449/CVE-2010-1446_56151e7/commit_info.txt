Subject: kgdb: don't needlessly skip PAGE_USER test for Fsl booke

CVE Identifiers:
- CVE-2010-1446

Full commit message:
kgdb: don't needlessly skip PAGE_USER test for Fsl booke

The bypassing of this test is a leftover from 2.4 vintage
kernels, and is no longer appropriate, or even used by KGDB.
Currently KGDB uses probe_kernel_write() for all access to
memory via the KGDB core, so it can simply be deleted.

This fixes CVE-2010-1446.
