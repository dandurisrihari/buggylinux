    KVM: SVM: Set RFLAGS.IF=1 in C code, to get VMRUN out of the STI shadow
    
    Enable/disable local IRQs, i.e. set/clear RFLAGS.IF, in the common
    svm_vcpu_enter_exit() just after/before guest_state_{enter,exit}_irqoff()
    so that VMRUN is not executed in an STI shadow.  AMD CPUs have a quirk
    (some would say "bug"), where the STI shadow bleeds into the guest's
    intr_state field if a #VMEXIT occurs during injection of an event, i.e. if
    the VMRUN doesn't complete before the subsequent #VMEXIT.
    
    The spurious "interrupts masked" state is relatively benign, as it only
    occurs during event injection and is transient.  Because KVM is already
    injecting an event, the guest can't be in HLT, and if KVM is querying IRQ
    blocking for injection, then KVM would need to force an immediate exit
    anyways since injecting multiple events is impossible.
    
    However, because KVM copies int_state verbatim from vmcb02 to vmcb12, the
    spurious STI shadow is visible to L1 when running a nested VM, which can
    trip sanity checks, e.g. in VMware's VMM.
    
    Hoist the STI+CLI all the way to C code, as the aforementioned calls to
    guest_state_{enter,exit}_irqoff() already inform lockdep that IRQs are
    enabled/disabled, and taking a fault on VMRUN with RFLAGS.IF=1 is already
    possible.  I.e. if there's kernel code that is confused by running with
    RFLAGS.IF=1, then it's already a problem.  In practice, since GIF=0 also
    blocks NMIs, the only change in exposure to non-KVM code (relative to
    surrounding VMRUN with STI+CLI) is exception handling code, and except for
    the kvm_rebooting=1 case, all exception in the core VM-Enter/VM-Exit path
    are fatal.
    
    Use the "raw" variants to enable/disable IRQs to avoid tracing in the
    "no instrumentation" code; the guest state helpers also take care of
    tracing IRQ state.
    
    Oppurtunstically document why KVM needs to do STI in the first place.
