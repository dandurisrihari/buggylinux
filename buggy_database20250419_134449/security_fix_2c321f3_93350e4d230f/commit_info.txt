Full commit message:
mm: change inlined allocation helpers to account at the call site

Main goal of memory allocation profiling patchset is to provide accounting
that is cheap enough to run in production.  To achieve that we inject
counters using codetags at the allocation call sites to account every time
allocation is made.  This injection allows us to perform accounting
efficiently because injected counters are immediately available as opposed
to the alternative methods, such as using _RET_IP_, which would require
counter lookup and appropriate locking that makes accounting much more
expensive.  This method requires all allocation functions to inject
separate counters at their call sites so that their callers can be
individually accounted.  Counter injection is implemented by allocation
hooks which should wrap all allocation functions.

Inlined functions which perform allocations but do not use allocation
hooks are directly charged for the allocations they perform.  In most
cases these functions are just specialized allocation wrappers used from
multiple places to allocate objects of a specific type.  It would be more
useful to do the accounting at their call sites instead.  Instrument these
helpers to do accounting at the call site.  Simple inlined allocation
wrappers are converted directly into macros.  More complex allocators or
allocators with documentation are converted into _noprof versions and
allocation hooks are added.  This allows memory allocation profiling
mechanism to charge allocations to the callers of these functions.
