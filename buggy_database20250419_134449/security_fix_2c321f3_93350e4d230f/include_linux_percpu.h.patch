    mm: change inlined allocation helpers to account at the call site
    
    Main goal of memory allocation profiling patchset is to provide accounting
    that is cheap enough to run in production.  To achieve that we inject
    counters using codetags at the allocation call sites to account every time
    allocation is made.  This injection allows us to perform accounting
    efficiently because injected counters are immediately available as opposed
    to the alternative methods, such as using _RET_IP_, which would require
    counter lookup and appropriate locking that makes accounting much more
    expensive.  This method requires all allocation functions to inject
    separate counters at their call sites so that their callers can be
    individually accounted.  Counter injection is implemented by allocation
    hooks which should wrap all allocation functions.
    
    Inlined functions which perform allocations but do not use allocation
    hooks are directly charged for the allocations they perform.  In most
    cases these functions are just specialized allocation wrappers used from
    multiple places to allocate objects of a specific type.  It would be more
    useful to do the accounting at their call sites instead.  Instrument these
    helpers to do accounting at the call site.  Simple inlined allocation
    wrappers are converted directly into macros.  More complex allocators or
    allocators with documentation are converted into _noprof versions and
    allocation hooks are added.  This allows memory allocation profiling
    mechanism to charge allocations to the callers of these functions.
