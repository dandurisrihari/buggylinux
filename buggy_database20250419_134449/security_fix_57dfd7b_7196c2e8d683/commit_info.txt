Full commit message:
KVM: x86: Move delivery of non-APICv interrupt into vendor code

Handle non-APICv interrupt delivery in vendor code, even though it means
VMX and SVM will temporarily have duplicate code.  SVM's AVIC has a race
condition that requires KVM to fall back to legacy interrupt injection
_after_ the interrupt has been logged in the vIRR, i.e. to fix the race,
SVM will need to open code the full flow anyways[*].  Refactor the code
so that the SVM bug without introducing other issues, e.g. SVM would
return "success" and thus invoke trace_kvm_apicv_accept_irq() even when
delivery through the AVIC failed, and to opportunistically prepare for
using KVM_X86_OP to fill each vendor's kvm_x86_ops struct, which will
rely on the vendor function matching the kvm_x86_op pointer name.

No functional change intended.
