Full commit message:
drm/edid: remove non_desktop quirk for HPN-3515 and LEN-B800.

Now that there is support for the Microsoft VSDB for HMDs, remove the
non-desktop quirk for two devices that are verified to contain it in
their EDID: HPN-3515 and LEN-B800.
Presumably most of the other Windows Mixed Reality headsets contain it
as well, but there are ACR-7FCE and SEC-5194 devices without it.

Tested with LEN-B800.
