    staging: erofs: introduce error injection infrastructure
    
    This patch introduces error injection infrastructure, with it, we can
    inject error in any kernel exported common functions which erofs used,
    so that it can force erofs running into error paths, it turns out that
    tests can cover real rare paths more easily to find bugs.
