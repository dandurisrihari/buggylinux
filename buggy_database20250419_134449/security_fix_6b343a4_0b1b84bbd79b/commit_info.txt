Full commit message:
EDAC/mc_sysfs: Replace deprecated strncpy() with memcpy()

`strncpy` is deprecated for use on NUL-terminated destination strings [1].

We've already calculated bounds, possible truncation with '\0' or '\n'
and manually NUL-terminated. The situation is now just a literal byte
copy from one buffer to another, let's treat it as such and use a less
ambiguous interface in memcpy.
