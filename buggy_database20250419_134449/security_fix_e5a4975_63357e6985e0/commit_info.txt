Full commit message:
nvme-fc: replace deprecated strncpy with strscpy

strncpy() is deprecated for use on NUL-terminated destination strings
[1] and as such we should prefer more robust and less ambiguous string
interfaces.

Let's instead use strscpy() [2] as it guarantees NUL-termination on the
destination buffer.

Moreover, there is no need to use:

|       min(FCNVME_ASSOC_HOSTNQN_LEN, NVMF_NQN_SIZE));

I imagine this was originally done to make sure the destination buffer
is NUL-terminated by ensuring we copy a number of bytes less than the
size of our destination, thus leaving some NUL-bytes at the end.

However, with strscpy(), we no longer need to do this and we can instead
opt for the more idiomatic strscpy() usage of:

| strscpy(dest, src, sizeof(dest))

Also, no NUL-padding is required as lsop is zero-allocated:

|       lsop = kzalloc((sizeof(*lsop) +
|                        sizeof(*assoc_rqst) + sizeof(*assoc_acc) +
|                        ctrl->lport->ops->lsrqst_priv_sz), GFP_KERNEL);

... and assoc_rqst points to a field in lsop:

|       assoc_rqst = (struct fcnvme_ls_cr_assoc_rqst *)&lsop[1];

Therefore, any additional NUL-byte assignments (like the ones that
strncpy() makes) are redundant.
