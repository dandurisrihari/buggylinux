    rslib: Split rs control struct
    
    The decoder library uses variable length arrays on stack. To get rid of
    them it would be simple to allocate fixed length arrays on stack, but those
    might become rather large. The other solution is to allocate the buffers in
    the rs control structure, but this cannot be done as long as the structure
    can be shared by several users. Sharing is desired because the RS polynom
    tables are large and initialization is time consuming.
    
    To solve this split the codec information out of the control structure and
    have a pointer to a shared codec in it. Instantiate the control structure
    for each user, create a new codec if no shareable is avaiable yet.  Adjust
    all affected usage sites to the new scheme.
    
    This allows to add per instance decoder buffers to the control structure
    later on.
