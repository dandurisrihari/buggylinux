Full commit message:
perf build: Suppress openssl v3 deprecation warnings in libcrypto feature test

With OpenSSL v3 installed, the libcrypto feature check fails as it use the
deprecated MD5_* API (and is compiled with -Werror). The error message is
as follows.

$ make tools/perf
```
Makefile.config:778: No libcrypto.h found, disables jitted code injection,
please install openssl-devel or libssl-dev

```

This is very confusing because the suggested library (on my Ubuntu 20.04
it is libssl-dev) is already installed. As the test only checks for the
presence of libcrypto, this commit suppresses the deprecation warning to
allow the test to pass.
