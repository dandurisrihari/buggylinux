Full commit message:
[Bluetooth] Export details about authentication requirements

With the Simple Pairing support, the authentication requirements are
an explicit setting during the bonding process. Track and enforce the
requirements and allow higher layers like L2CAP and RFCOMM to increase
them if needed.

This patch introduces a new IOCTL that allows to query the current
authentication requirements. It is also possible to detect Simple
Pairing support in the kernel this way.
