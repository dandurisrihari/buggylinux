Such notification will take place\nafter multi-channel support will be added: mac80211 will likely send a\nremain-on-channel notification to drivers when entering sensitive\nstates (like authentication), otherwise the firmware might jump to\ndifferent channels (to serve a different role).\n\nUntil those notifications materialize, disable the hw BSSID filter\nwhen authentication requests are sent, so roaming would work.\n\nSigned-off-by: Ohad Ben-Cohen <ohad@wizery.com>\nReviewed-by: Luciano Coelho <coelho@ti.com>\nSigned-off-by: Luciano Coelho <coelho@ti.com>",
