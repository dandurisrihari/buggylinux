Full commit message:
KVM: Introduce direct MSI message injection for in-kernel irqchips

Currently, MSI messages can only be injected to in-kernel irqchips by
defining a corresponding IRQ route for each message. This is not only
unhandy if the MSI messages are generated "on the fly" by user space,
IRQ routes are a limited resource that user space has to manage
carefully.

By providing a direct injection path, we can both avoid using up limited
resources and simplify the necessary steps for user land.
