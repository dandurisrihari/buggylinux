Full commit message:
nvme: rework NVME_AUTH Kconfig selection

Having a single Kconfig symbol NVME_AUTH conflates the selection
of the authentication functions from nvme/common and nvme/host,
causing kbuild robot to complain when building the nvme target
only. So introduce a Kconfig symbol NVME_HOST_AUTH for the nvme
host bits and use NVME_AUTH for the common functions only.
And move the CRYPTO selection into nvme/common to make it
easier to read.
