Full commit message:
wifi: cfg80211: Authentication offload to user space for MLO connection in STA mode

Currently authentication request event interface doesn't have support to
indicate the user space whether it should enable MLO or not during the
authentication with the specified AP. But driver needs such capability
since the connection is MLO or not decided by the driver in case of SME
offload to the driver.

Add support for driver to indicate MLD address of the AP in
authentication offload request to inform user space to enable MLO during
authentication process. Driver shall look at NL80211_ATTR_MLO_SUPPORT
flag capability in NL80211_CMD_CONNECT to know whether the user space
supports enabling MLO during the authentication offload.

User space should enable MLO during the authentication only when it
receives the AP MLD address in authentication offload request. User
space shouldn't enable MLO if the authentication offload request doesn't
indicate the AP MLD address even if the AP is MLO capable.

When MLO is enabled, user space should use the MAC address of the
interface (on which driver sent request) as self MLD address. User space
and driver to use MLD addresses in RA, TA and BSSID fields of the frames
between them, and driver translates the MLD addresses to/from link
addresses based on the link chosen for the authentication.
