  "body": "Currently authentication request event interface doesn't have support to\nindicate the user space whether it should enable MLO or not during the\nauthentication with the specified AP. But driver needs such capability\nsince the connection is MLO or not decided by the driver in case of SME\noffload to the driver.\n\nAdd support for driver to indicate MLD address of the AP in\nauthentication offload request to inform user space to enable MLO during\nauthentication process. Driver shall look at NL80211_ATTR_MLO_SUPPORT\nflag capability in NL80211_CMD_CONNECT to know whether the user space\nsupports enabling MLO during the authentication offload.\n\nUser space should enable MLO during the authentication only when it\nreceives the AP MLD address in authentication offload request. User\nspace shouldn't enable MLO if the authentication offload request doesn't\nindicate the AP MLD address even if the AP is MLO capable.\n\nWhen MLO is enabled, user space should use the MAC address of the\ninterface (on which driver sent request) as self MLD address. User space\nand driver to use MLD addresses in RA, TA and BSSID fields of the frames\nbetween them, and driver translates the MLD addresses to/from link\naddresses based on the link chosen for the authentication.\n\nSigned-off-by: Veerendranath Jakkam <quic_vjakkam@quicinc.com>\nLink: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20230116125058.1604843-1-quic_vjakkam@quicinc.com\nSigned-off-by: Johannes Berg <johannes.berg@intel.com>",
