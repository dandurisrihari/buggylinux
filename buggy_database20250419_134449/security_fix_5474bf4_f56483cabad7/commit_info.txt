Full commit message:
btrfs: check whether fsgid/fsuid are mapped during subvolume creation

When a new subvolume is created btrfs currently doesn't check whether
the fsgid/fsuid of the caller actually have a mapping in the user
namespace attached to the filesystem. The VFS always checks this to make
sure that the caller's fsgid/fsuid can be represented on-disk. This is
most relevant for filesystems that can be mounted inside user namespaces
but it is in general a good hardening measure to prevent unrepresentable
gid/uid from being written to disk.

Since we want to support idmapped mounts for btrfs ioctls to create
subvolumes in follow-up patches this becomes important since we want to
make sure the fsgid/fsuid of the caller as mapped according to the
idmapped mount can be represented on-disk. Simply add the missing
fsuidgid_has_mapping() line from the VFS may_create() version to
btrfs_may_create().
