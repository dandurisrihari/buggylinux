This means that a backend might\nreside in a less trusted environment than the Xen core components, so\na backend should not be able to do harm to a Xen guest (it can still\nmess up I/O data, but it shouldn't be able to e.g. crash a guest by\nother means or cause a privilege escalation in the guest).\n\nUnfortunately netfront in the Linux kernel is fully trusting its\nbackend. This series is fixing netfront in this regard.\n\nIt was discussed to handle this as a security problem, but the topic\nwas discussed in public before, so it isn't a real secret.\n\nIt should be mentioned that a similar series has been posted some years\nago by Marek Marczykowski-G\u00f3recki, but this series has not been applied\ndue to a Xen header not having been available in the Xen git repo at\nthat time. Additionally my series is fixing some more DoS cases.\n====================\n\nSigned-off-by: David S. Miller <davem@davemloft.net>",
