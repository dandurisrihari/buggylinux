Full commit message:
Merge remote-tracking branch 'upstream/master' into queue

Merge reason:

From: Alexander Graf <agraf@suse.de>

"Just recently this really important patch got pulled into Linus' tree for 3.9:

commit 1674400aaee5b466c595a8fc310488263ce888c7
Author: Anton Blanchard <anton <at> samba.org>
Date:   Tue Mar 12 01:51:51 2013 +0000

Without that commit, I can not boot my G5, thus I can't run automated tests on it against my queue.

Could you please merge kvm/next against linus/master, so that I can base my trees against that?"
