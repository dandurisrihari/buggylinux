  "body": "The cpu idle cooling device offers a new method to cool down a CPU by\ninjecting idle cycles at runtime.\n\nIt has some similarities with the intel power clamp driver but it is\nactually designed to be more generic and relying on the idle injection\npowercap framework.\n\nThe idle injection duration is fixed while the running duration is\nvariable. That allows to have control on the device reactivity for the\nuser experience.\n\nAn idle state powering down the CPU or the cluster will allow to drop\nthe static leakage, thus restoring the heat capacity of the SoC. It\ncan be set with a trip point between the hot and the critical points,\ngiving the opportunity to prevent a hard reset of the system when the\ncpufreq cooling fails to cool down the CPU.\n\nWith more sophisticated boards having a per core sensor, the idle\ncooling device allows to cool down a single core without throttling\nthe compute capacity of several cpus belonging to the same clock line,\nso it could be used in collaboration with the cpufreq cooling device.\n\nSigned-off-by: Daniel Lezcano <daniel.lezcano@linaro.org>\nAcked-by: Viresh Kumar <viresh.kumar@linaro.org>\nLink: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20191219225317.17158-2-daniel.lezcano@linaro.org",
