Full commit message:
Merge tag 'docs-6.9' of git://git.lwn.net/linux

Pull documentation updates from Jonathan Corbet:
 "A moderatly busy cycle for development this time around.

   - Some cleanup of the main index page for easier navigation

   - Rework some of the other top-level pages for better readability
     and, with luck, fewer merge conflicts in the future.

   - Submit-checklist improvements, hopefully the first of many.

   - New Italian translations

   - A fair number of kernel-doc fixes and improvements. We have also
     dropped the recommendation to use an old version of Sphinx.

   - A new document from Thorsten on bisection

  ... and lots of fixes and updates"
