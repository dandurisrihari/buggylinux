    x86, apicv: add virtual interrupt delivery support
    
    Virtual interrupt delivery avoids KVM to inject vAPIC interrupts
    manually, which is fully taken care of by the hardware. This needs
    some special awareness into existing interrupr injection path:
    
    - for pending interrupt, instead of direct injection, we may need
      update architecture specific indicators before resuming to guest.
    
    - A pending interrupt, which is masked by ISR, should be also
      considered in above update action, since hardware will decide
      when to inject it at right time. Current has_interrupt and
      get_interrupt only returns a valid vector from injection p.o.v.
