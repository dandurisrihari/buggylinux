    SUNRPC: Server-side disconnect injection
    
    Disconnect injection stress-tests the ability for both client and
    server implementations to behave resiliently in the face of network
    instability.
    
    A file called /sys/kernel/debug/fail_sunrpc/ignore-server-disconnect
    enables administrators to turn off server-side disconnect injection
    while allowing other types of sunrpc errors to be injected. The
    default setting is that server-side disconnect injection is enabled
    (ignore=false).
