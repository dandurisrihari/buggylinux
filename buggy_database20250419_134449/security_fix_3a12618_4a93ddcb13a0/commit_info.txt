Full commit message:
SUNRPC: Server-side disconnect injection

Disconnect injection stress-tests the ability for both client and
server implementations to behave resiliently in the face of network
instability.

A file called /sys/kernel/debug/fail_sunrpc/ignore-server-disconnect
enables administrators to turn off server-side disconnect injection
while allowing other types of sunrpc errors to be injected. The
default setting is that server-side disconnect injection is enabled
(ignore=false).
