Full commit message:
wifi: rtl8xxxu: RTL8192EU always needs full init

Always run the entire init sequence (rtl8xxxu_init_device()) for
RTL8192EU. It's what the vendor driver does too.

This fixes a bug where the device is unable to connect after
rebooting:

wlp3s0f3u2: send auth to ... (try 1/3)
wlp3s0f3u2: send auth to ... (try 2/3)
wlp3s0f3u2: send auth to ... (try 3/3)
wlp3s0f3u2: authentication with ... timed out

Rebooting leaves the device powered on (partially? at least the
firmware is still running), but not really in a working state.
