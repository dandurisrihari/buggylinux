Merge tag 'qcom-drivers-for-5.18' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/qcom/linux into arm/drivers

Qualcomm driver updates for v5.18

This refactors the Qualcomm mdt file loader, to partially decouple it
from the SCM peripheral-authentication-service. This is needed as newer
platforms, such as the Qualcomm SM8450, require the metadata to remain
accessible to TrustZone during a longer time. This is followed by the
introduction of remoteproc drivers for SM8450 (Snapdragon 8 Gen 1).

It changes the way hardware version differences are handled in the LLCC
driver and introduces support for Qualcomm SM8450. While updating the dt
binding for LLCC it also introduces the missing SM8350 compatible.

The ocmem and aoss drivers gains missing put_device() calls and rpmpd
gains a missing check for kcalloc() failure.

The SPM driver is updated to avoid instantiating the SPM cpuidle devices
if the CPUs aren't controlled by SPM, such as when Snapdragon 8916
operates in 32-bit mode without PSCI.

The RPM power-domain driver gains MSM8226 support.

Lastly the socinfo driver gains knowledge about a few new SoCs and
PMICs.
