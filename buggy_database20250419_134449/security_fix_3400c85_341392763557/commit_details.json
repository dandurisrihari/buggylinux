In addition, the size of shared memory used for communication\nbetween driver and platform is fixed, namely 64 Bytes which is\nunchangeable. So add the verification for hardening code.\n\nSigned-off-by: Huisong Li <lihuisong@huawei.com>\nReviewed-by: Jonathan Cameron <Jonathan.Cameron@huawei.com>\nSigned-off-by: Wei Xu <xuwei5@hisilicon.com>",
