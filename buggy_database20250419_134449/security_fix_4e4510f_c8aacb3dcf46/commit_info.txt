Merge tag 'sound-4.15-rc1' of ssh://gitolite.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tiwai/sound

Pull sound updates from Takashi Iwai:
 "There are no big surprising changes in this cycle, yet not too boring,
  either. The biggest change from diffstat POV is the removal of the
  legacy OSS driver codes that have been already disabled for a long
  time. This will bring a few trivial merge conflicts.

  As new features in ASoC side, there are two things: a new AC97 bus
  implementation and AMD Stony platform support. Both include the
  relevant changes shared with other subsystems, e.g. AC97 MFD changes
  and DRM AMD changes.

  Some other highlighted topics are:

   - A bunch of USB-audio drivers got the hardening against the
     malicious device accesses with a new helper code for endpoint
     sanity check

   - Lots of cleanups for ASoC Intel platform code, including support
     for their open source audio firmware

   - Continued ASoC core componentization works

   - Support for scaling MCLK with sample rate in ASoC simple-card

   - Stabler PCM hot-unplug capability, especially for ASoC usages"
