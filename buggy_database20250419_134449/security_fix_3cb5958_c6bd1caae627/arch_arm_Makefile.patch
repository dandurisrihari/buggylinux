    ARM: 8588/1: localise objcopy flags
    
    We currently define OBJCOPYFLAGS in the top-level arm Makefile, and thus
    these flags will be passed to all uses of objcopy, kernel-wide, for
    which they are not explicitly overridden. The flags we set are intended
    for converting a few ELF files into raw binaries, and thus the flags
    chosen are problematic for some other uses which do not expect a raw
    binary result, e.g. the upcoming lkdtm rodata test:
    
      http://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2016/06/08/2
    
    This patch localises the objcopy flags such that they are only used for
    the cases we require them for today.
