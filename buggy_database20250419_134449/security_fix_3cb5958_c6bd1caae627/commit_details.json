The flags we set are intended\nfor converting a few ELF files into raw binaries, and thus the flags\nchosen are problematic for some other uses which do not expect a raw\nbinary result, e.g. the upcoming lkdtm rodata test:\n\n  http://www.openwall.com/lists/kernel-hardening/2016/06/08/2\n\nThis patch localises the objcopy flags such that they are only used for\nthe cases we require them for today.\n\nSigned-off-by: Mark Rutland <mark.rutland@arm.com>\nAcked-by: Kees Cook <keescook@chromium.org>\nTested-by: Laura Abbott <labbott@redhat.com>\nCc: Russell King <linux@armlinux.org.uk>\nSigned-off-by: Russell King <rmk+kernel@arm.linux.org.uk>",
