[MAC80211]: Improve sanity checks on injected packets

Michael Wu noticed that the skb length checking is not taken care of enough when
a packet is presented on the Monitor interface for injection.

This patch improves the sanity checking and removes fake offsets placed
into the skb network and transport header.
