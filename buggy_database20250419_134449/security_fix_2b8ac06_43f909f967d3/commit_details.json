  "body": "This driver has had problems when handling data errors.  Add fault\ninjection support so that the abort handling can be easily triggered and\nregression-tested.  A hrtimer is used to indicate a data CRC error at\nvarious points during the data transfer.\n\nNote that for the recent problem with hangs in the case of some data CRC\nerrors, a udelay(10) inserted at the start of send_stop_abort() greatly\nhelped in triggering the error, but I've not included this as part of\nthe fault injection support since it seemed too specific.\n\nSigned-off-by: Vincent Whitchurch <vincent.whitchurch@axis.com>\nReviewed-by: Jaehoon Chung <jh80.chung@samsung.com>\nLink: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20210701080534.23138-1-vincent.whitchurch@axis.com\nSigned-off-by: Ulf Hansson <ulf.hansson@linaro.org>",
