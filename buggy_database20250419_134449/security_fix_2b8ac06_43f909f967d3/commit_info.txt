mmc: dw_mmc: Add data CRC error injection

This driver has had problems when handling data errors.  Add fault
injection support so that the abort handling can be easily triggered and
regression-tested.  A hrtimer is used to indicate a data CRC error at
various points during the data transfer.

Note that for the recent problem with hangs in the case of some data CRC
errors, a udelay(10) inserted at the start of send_stop_abort() greatly
helped in triggering the error, but I've not included this as part of
the fault injection support since it seemed too specific.
