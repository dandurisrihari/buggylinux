Johannes Berg says:

====================
New features for the wifi stack:
 * airtime fairness scheduling in mac80211, so we can share
 * more authentication offloads to userspace - this is for
   SAE which is part of WPA3 and is hard to do in firmware
 * documentation fixes
 * various mesh improvements
 * various other small improvements/cleanups

This also contains the NLA_POLICY_NESTED{,_ARRAY} change we
discussed, which affects everyone but there's no other user
yet.
