    x86/speculation/l1tf: Drop the swap storage limit restriction when l1tf=off
    
    Swap storage is restricted to max_swapfile_size (~16TB on x86_64) whenever
    the system is deemed affected by L1TF vulnerability. Even though the limit
    is quite high for most deployments it seems to be too restrictive for
    deployments which are willing to live with the mitigation disabled.
    
    We have a customer to deploy 8x 6,4TB PCIe/NVMe SSD swap devices which is
    clearly out of the limit.
    
    Drop the swap restriction when l1tf=off is specified. It also doesn't make
    much sense to warn about too much memory for the l1tf mitigation when it is
    forcefully disabled by the administrator.
    
    [ tglx: Folded the documentation delta change ]
