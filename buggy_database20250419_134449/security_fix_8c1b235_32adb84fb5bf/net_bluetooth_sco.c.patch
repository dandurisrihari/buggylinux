    Bluetooth: Add enhanced security model for Simple Pairing
    
    The current security model is based around the flags AUTH, ENCRYPT and
    SECURE. Starting with support for the Bluetooth 2.1 specification this is
    no longer sufficient. The different security levels are now defined as
    SDP, LOW, MEDIUM and SECURE.
    
    Previously it was possible to set each security independently, but this
    actually doesn't make a lot of sense. For Bluetooth the encryption depends
    on a previous successful authentication. Also you can only update your
    existing link key if you successfully created at least one before. And of
    course the update of link keys without having proper encryption in place
    is a security issue.
    
    The new security levels from the Bluetooth 2.1 specification are now
    used internally. All old settings are mapped to the new values and this
    way it ensures that old applications still work. The only limitation
    is that it is no longer possible to set authentication without also
    enabling encryption. No application should have done this anyway since
    this is actually a security issue. Without encryption the integrity of
    the authentication can't be guaranteed.
    
    As default for a new L2CAP or RFCOMM connection, the LOW security level
    is used. The only exception here are the service discovery sessions on
    PSM 1 where SDP level is used. To have similar security strength as with
    a Bluetooth 2.0 and before combination key, the MEDIUM level should be
    used. This is according to the Bluetooth specification. The MEDIUM level
    will not require any kind of man-in-the-middle (MITM) protection. Only
    the HIGH security level will require this.
