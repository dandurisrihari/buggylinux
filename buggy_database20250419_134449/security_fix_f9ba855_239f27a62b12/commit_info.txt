Full commit message:
arm64: dts: qcom: sm8350: Fix ADSP memory base and length

The address space in ADSP PAS (Peripheral Authentication Service)
remoteproc node should point to the QDSP PUB address space
(QDSP6...SS_PUB): 0x0300_0000 with length of 0x10000.  0x1730_0000,
value used so far, was copied from downstream DTS, is in the middle of
unused space and downstream DTS describes the PIL loader, which is a bit
different interface.

Assume existing value (thus downstream DTS) is not really describing the
intended ADSP PAS region.

Correct the base address and length, which also moves the node to
different place to keep things sorted by unit address.  The diff looks
big, but only the unit address and "reg" property were changed.  This
should have no functional impact on Linux users, because PAS loader does
not use this address space at all.
