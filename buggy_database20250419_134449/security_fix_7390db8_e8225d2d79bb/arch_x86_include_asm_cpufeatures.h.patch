    x86/bhi: Add support for clearing branch history at syscall entry
    
    Branch History Injection (BHI) attacks may allow a malicious application to
    influence indirect branch prediction in kernel by poisoning the branch
    history. eIBRS isolates indirect branch targets in ring0.  The BHB can
    still influence the choice of indirect branch predictor entry, and although
    branch predictor entries are isolated between modes when eIBRS is enabled,
    the BHB itself is not isolated between modes.
    
    Alder Lake and new processors supports a hardware control BHI_DIS_S to
    mitigate BHI.  For older processors Intel has released a software sequence
    to clear the branch history on parts that don't support BHI_DIS_S. Add
    support to execute the software sequence at syscall entry and VMexit to
    overwrite the branch history.
    
    For now, branch history is not cleared at interrupt entry, as malicious
    applications are not believed to have sufficient control over the
    registers, since previous register state is cleared at interrupt
    entry. Researchers continue to poke at this area and it may become
    necessary to clear at interrupt entry as well in the future.
    
    This mitigation is only defined here. It is enabled later.
