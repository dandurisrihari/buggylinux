    [CIFS] SMB3 Signing enablement
    
    SMB3 uses a much faster method of signing (which is also better in other ways),
    AES-CMAC.  With the kernel now supporting AES-CMAC since last release, we
    are overdue to allow SMB3 signing (today only CIFS and SMB2 and SMB2.1,
    but not SMB3 and SMB3.1 can sign) - and we need this also for checking
    secure negotation and also per-share encryption (two other new SMB3 features
    which we need to implement).
    
    This patch needs some work in a few areas - for example we need to
    move signing for SMB2/SMB3 from per-socket to per-user (we may be able to
    use the "nosharesock" mount option in the interim for the multiuser case),
    and Shirish found a bug in the earlier authentication overhaul
    (setting signing flags properly) - but those can be done in followon
    patches.
