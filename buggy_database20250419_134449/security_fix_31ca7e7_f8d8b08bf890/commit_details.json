  "body": "strncpy() is deprecated for use on NUL-terminated destination strings\n[1] and as such we should prefer more robust and less ambiguous string\ninterfaces.\n\nOur goal here is to get @namebuf populated with @name's contents but\nsurrounded with quotes. There is some careful handling done to ensure we\nproperly truncate @name so that we have room for a literal quote as well\nas a NUL-term. All this careful handling can be done with scnprintf\nusing the dynamic string width specifier %.*s which allows us to pass in\nthe max size for a source string. Doing this, we can put literal quotes\nin our format specifier and ensure @name is truncated to fit inbetween\nthese quotes (-3 is from 2 quotes + 1 NUL-byte).\n\nAll in all, we get to remove a deprecated use of strncpy and clean up\nthis code nicely!\n\nLink: https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/deprecated.html#strncpy-on-nul-terminated-strings [1]\nLink: https://manpages.debian.org/testing/linux-manual-4.8/strscpy.9.en.html [2]\nLink: https://github.com/KSPP/linux/issues/90\nCc:  <linux-hardening@vger.kernel.org>\nSigned-off-by: Justin Stitt <justinstitt@google.com>\nReviewed-by: Kees Cook <keescook@chromium.org>\nLink: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20240328-strncpy-fs-reiserfs-item_ops-c-v1-1-2dab6d22a996@google.com\nSigned-off-by: Kees Cook <keescook@chromium.org>",
