Full commit message:
reiserfs: replace deprecated strncpy with scnprintf

strncpy() is deprecated for use on NUL-terminated destination strings
[1] and as such we should prefer more robust and less ambiguous string
interfaces.

Our goal here is to get @namebuf populated with @name's contents but
surrounded with quotes. There is some careful handling done to ensure we
properly truncate @name so that we have room for a literal quote as well
as a NUL-term. All this careful handling can be done with scnprintf
using the dynamic string width specifier %.*s which allows us to pass in
the max size for a source string. Doing this, we can put literal quotes
in our format specifier and ensure @name is truncated to fit inbetween
these quotes (-3 is from 2 quotes + 1 NUL-byte).

All in all, we get to remove a deprecated use of strncpy and clean up
this code nicely!
