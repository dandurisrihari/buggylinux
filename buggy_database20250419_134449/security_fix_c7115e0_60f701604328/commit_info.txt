f2fs: introduce FAULT_BLKADDR_CONSISTENCE

We will encounter below inconsistent status when FAULT_BLKADDR type
fault injection is on.

After we inject fault into f2fs_is_valid_blkaddr() during truncation,
a) it missed to increase @nr_free or @valid_blocks
b) it can cause in blkaddr leak in truncated dnode
Which may cause inconsistent status.

This patch separates FAULT_BLKADDR_CONSISTENCE from FAULT_BLKADDR,
and rename FAULT_BLKADDR to FAULT_BLKADDR_VALIDITY
so that we can:
a) use FAULT_BLKADDR_CONSISTENCE in f2fs_truncate_data_blocks_range()
to simulate inconsistent issue independently, then it can verify fsck
repair flow.
b) FAULT_BLKADDR_VALIDITY fault will not cause any inconsistent status,
we can just use it to check error path handling in kernel side.
