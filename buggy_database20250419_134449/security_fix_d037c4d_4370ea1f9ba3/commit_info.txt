Merge branch 'for-davem' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/linville/wireless-next

John W. Linville says:

====================
Please pull this batch of updates for the 3.14 stream!

For the mac80211 bits, Johannes says:

"This time I have uAPSD fixes since I was working on that, hwsim
improvements to make dynamic radios possible for the test suite, the
evidently long-overdue channel_change_time removal and a few other small
collected fix and improvements."

For the iwlwifi bits, Emmanuel says:

"Besides a few trivial patches, I have an important workaround for a HW
issue that has kept me busy for a long time. Along with it, a fix that
prevents an error from being printed.
Eyal fixes our behavior against SISO APs and Ilan fixes an issue with
multiple interface scenarios.
Eliad fixes an error path in our init flow.
We also have a few 'static analyzers' fix."

For the NFC bits, Samuel says:

"It includes:

* A new NFC driver for Marvell's 8897, and a few NCI fixes and
  improvements needed to support this chipset.

* An LLCP fix for how we were setting the default MIU on a p2p link. If
  there is no explicit MIU extension announced at connection time, we
  must use the default one and not the one announced at LLCP link
  establishement time.

* A pn544 EEPROM config update. Some of the currently EEPROM configured
  values are overwriting the firmware ones while other should not be set
  by the driver itself.

* Some NFC digital stack fixes and improvements. Asynchronous functions
  are better documented, RF technologies and CRC functions are set upon
  PSL_REQ reception, and a few minor bugs are fixed.

* Minor and miscelaneous pn533, mei_phy and port100 fixes."

For the ath bits, Kalle says:

"Janusz added Kconfig option for DFS. The DFS code was there already, but
after fixes to mac80211 we can now enable it.

Bartosz added a runtime firmware feature flag to disable P2P. Our 10.1
firmware branch doesn't support P2P and ath10k can now disable that. He
also added a limit for how many clients can connect to ath10k AP.

Michal fixed WEP shared authentication, in case someone still uses it.
And I added firmware debug log to help the firmware engineers."

Along with that is a small batch of ath9k updates and a few other bits
here and there.
