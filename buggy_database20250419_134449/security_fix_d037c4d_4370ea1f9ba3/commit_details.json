Linville says:\n\n====================\nPlease pull this batch of updates for the 3.14 stream!\n\nFor the mac80211 bits, Johannes says:\n\n\"This time I have uAPSD fixes since I was working on that, hwsim\nimprovements to make dynamic radios possible for the test suite, the\nevidently long-overdue channel_change_time removal and a few other small\ncollected fix and improvements.\"\n\nFor the iwlwifi bits, Emmanuel says:\n\n\"Besides a few trivial patches, I have an important workaround for a HW\nissue that has kept me busy for a long time. Along with it, a fix that\nprevents an error from being printed.\nEyal fixes our behavior against SISO APs and Ilan fixes an issue with\nmultiple interface scenarios.\nEliad fixes an error path in our init flow.\nWe also have a few 'static analyzers' fix.\"\n\nFor the NFC bits, Samuel says:\n\n\"It includes:\n\n* A new NFC driver for Marvell's 8897, and a few NCI fixes and\n  improvements needed to support this chipset.\n\n* An LLCP fix for how we were setting the default MIU on a p2p link. If\n  there is no explicit MIU extension announced at connection time, we\n  must use the default one and not the one announced at LLCP link\n  establishement time.\n\n* A pn544 EEPROM config update. Some of the currently EEPROM configured\n  values are overwriting the firmware ones while other should not be set\n  by the driver itself.\n\n* Some NFC digital stack fixes and improvements. Asynchronous functions\n  are better documented, RF technologies and CRC functions are set upon\n  PSL_REQ reception, and a few minor bugs are fixed.\n\n* Minor and miscelaneous pn533, mei_phy and port100 fixes.\"\n\nFor the ath bits, Kalle says:\n\n\"Janusz added Kconfig option for DFS. The DFS code was there already, but\nafter fixes to mac80211 we can now enable it.\n\nBartosz added a runtime firmware feature flag to disable P2P. Our 10.1\nfirmware branch doesn't support P2P and ath10k can now disable that. He\nalso added a limit for how many clients can connect to ath10k AP.\n\nMichal fixed WEP shared authentication, in case someone still uses it.\nAnd I added firmware debug log to help the firmware engineers.\"\n\nAlong with that is a small batch of ath9k updates and a few other bits\nhere and there.\n====================\n\nSigned-off-by: David S.
