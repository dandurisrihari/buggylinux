Full commit message:
[POWERPC] spufs: avoid accessing kernel memory through mmapped /mem node

I found an exploit in current kernel.
Currently, there is no range check about mmapping "/mem" node in
spufs. Thus, an application can access privilege memory region.

In case this kernel already worked on a public server, I send this
information only here.
If there are such servers in somewhere, please replace it, ASAP.
