arm64: Relax ARM_SMCCC_ARCH_WORKAROUND_1 discovery

A recent update to the ARM SMCCC ARCH_WORKAROUND_1 specification
allows firmware to return a non zero, positive value to describe
that although the mitigation is implemented at the higher exception
level, the CPU on which the call is made is not affected.

Let's relax the check on the return value from ARCH_WORKAROUND_1
so that we only error out if the returned value is negative.
