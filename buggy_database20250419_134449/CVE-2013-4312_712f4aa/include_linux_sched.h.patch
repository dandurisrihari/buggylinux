    unix: properly account for FDs passed over unix sockets
    
    It is possible for a process to allocate and accumulate far more FDs than
    the process' limit by sending them over a unix socket then closing them
    to keep the process' fd count low.
    
    This change addresses this problem by keeping track of the number of FDs
    in flight per user and preventing non-privileged processes from having
    more FDs in flight than their configured FD limit.
