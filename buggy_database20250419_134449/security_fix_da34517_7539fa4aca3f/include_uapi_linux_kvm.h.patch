    KVM: arm/arm64: Allow user injection of external data aborts
    
    In some scenarios, such as buggy guest or incorrect configuration of the
    VMM and firmware description data, userspace will detect a memory access
    to a portion of the IPA, which is not mapped to any MMIO region.
    
    For this purpose, the appropriate action is to inject an external abort
    to the guest.  The kernel already has functionality to inject an
    external abort, but we need to wire up a signal from user space that
    lets user space tell the kernel to do this.
    
    It turns out, we already have the set event functionality which we can
    perfectly reuse for this.
