Full commit message:
RDMA/irdma: Replace deprecated strncpy

`strncpy` is deprecated for use on NUL-terminated destination strings [1]
and as such we should prefer more robust and less ambiguous string
interfaces.

A suitable replacement is `strscpy_pad` due to the fact that it
guarantees NUL-termination on the destination buffer.

It is unclear to me whether `i40iw_client.name` requires NUL-padding but
have opted to keep the NUL-padding behavior that strncpy provides to
ensure no functional change.
