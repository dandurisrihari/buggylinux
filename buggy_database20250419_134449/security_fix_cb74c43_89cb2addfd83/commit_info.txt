[PATCH] SoftMAC: Prevent multiple authentication attempts on the same network

This patch addresses the "No queue exists" messages commonly seen during
authentication and associating.  These appear due to scheduling multiple
authentication attempts on the same network.  To prevent this, I added a
flag to stop multiple authentication attempts by the association layer.
I also added a check to the wx handler to see if we're connecting to a
different network than the one already in progress.  This scenario was
causing multiple requests on the same network because the network BSSID
was not being updated despite the fact that the ESSID changed.
