    bnx2x: Improve reliability in case of nested PCI errors
    
    While in recovery process of PCI error (called EEH on PowerPC arch),
    another PCI transaction could be corrupted causing a situation of
    nested PCI errors. Also, this scenario could be reproduced with
    error injection mechanisms (for debug purposes).
    
    We observe that in case of nested PCI errors, bnx2x might attempt to
    initialize its shmem and cause a kernel crash due to bad addresses
    read from MCP. Multiple different stack traces were observed depending
    on the point the second PCI error happens.
    
    This patch avoids the crashes by:
    
     * failing PCI recovery in case of nested errors (since multiple
     PCI errors in a row are not expected to lead to a functional
     adapter anyway), and by,
    
     * preventing access to adapter FW when MCP is failed (we mark it as
     failed when shmem cannot get initialized properly).
