====================
pull request: wireless 2014-06-18

Please pull this batch of fixes intended for the 3.16 stream!

For the Bluetooth bits, Gustavo says:

"This is our first batch of fixes for 3.16. Be aware that two patches here
are not exactly bugfixes:

* 71f28af57066 Bluetooth: Add clarifying comment for conn->auth_type
This commit just add some important security comments to the code, we found
it important enough to include it here for 3.16 since it is security related.

* 9f7ec8871132 Bluetooth: Refactor discovery stopping into its own function
This commit is just a refactor in a preparation for a fix in the next
commit (f8680f128b).

All the other patches are fixes for deadlocks and for the Bluetooth protocols,
most of them related to authentication and encryption."

On top of that...

Chin-Ran Lo fixes a problems with overlapping DMA areas in mwifiex.

Michael Braun corrects a couple of issues in order to enable a new
device in rt2800usb.

Rafał Miłecki reverts a b43 patch that caused a regression, fixes a
Kconfig typo, and corrects a frequency reporting error with the G-PHY.

Stanislaw Grsuzka fixes an rfkill regression for rt2500pci, and avoids
a rt2x00 scheduling while atomic BUG.

Please let me know if there are problems!
