    greybus: Add Component Authentication Protocol support
    
    This patch adds Component Authentication Protocol support in greybus.
    The purpose of the CAP protocol is to authenticate the Module hardware,
    and it can only be used when it is present as part of the
    firmware-management bundle, on a separate CPort.
    
    Compile tested only.
