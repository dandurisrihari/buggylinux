experienced issues with error interrupts not working, even with the
following configuration in the BIOS.

    In-Band ECC Support: Enabled
    In-Band ECC Operation Mode: 2 (make all requests protected and
                                   ignore range checks)
    IBECC Error Injection Control: Inject Correctable Error on insertion
                                   counter

Add polling mode support for these machines to ensure that memory error
events are handled.
