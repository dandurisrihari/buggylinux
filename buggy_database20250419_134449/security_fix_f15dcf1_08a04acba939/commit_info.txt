Full commit message:
KVM: arm64: selftests: get-reg-list: Add pauth configuration

The get-reg-list test ignores the Pointer Authentication features,
which is a shame now that we have relatively common HW with this feature.

Define two new configurations (with and without PMU) that exercise the
KVM capabilities.
