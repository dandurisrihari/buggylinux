    cfg80211/mac80211: Allow user space to register for station Rx authentication
    
    To support Pre Association Security Negotiation (PASN) while already
    associated to one AP, allow user space to register to Rx
    authentication frames, so that the user space logic would be able to
    receive/handle authentication frames from a different AP as part of
    PASN.
    
    Note that it is expected that user space would intelligently register
    for Rx authentication frames, i.e., only when PASN is used and
    configure a match filter only for PASN authentication algorithm, as
    otherwise the MLME functionality of mac80211 would be broken.
    
    Additionally, since some versions of the user space daemons wrongly
    register to all types of authentication frames (which might result in
    unexpected behavior) allow such registration if the request is for a
    specific authentication algorithm number.
