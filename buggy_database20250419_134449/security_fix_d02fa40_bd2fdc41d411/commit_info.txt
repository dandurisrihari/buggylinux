Full commit message:
powerpc/powernv: Remove POWER9 PVR version check for entry and uaccess flushes

These aren't necessarily POWER9 only, and it's not to say some new
vulnerability may not get discovered on other processors for which
we would like the flexibility of having the workaround enabled by
firmware.

Remove the restriction that the workarounds only apply to POWER9.

However POWER7 and POWER8 are not affected, and they may not have
older firmware that does not advertise this, so clear these workarounds
manually.
