    genirq: Provide interrupt injection mechanism
    
    Error injection mechanisms need a half ways safe way to inject interrupts as
    invoking generic_handle_irq() or the actual device interrupt handler
    directly from e.g. a debugfs write is not guaranteed to be safe.
    
    On x86 generic_handle_irq() is unsafe due to the hardware trainwreck which
    is the base of x86 interrupt delivery and affinity management.
    
    Move the irq debugfs injection code into a separate function which can be
    used by error injection code as well.
    
    The implementation prevents at least that state is corrupted, but it cannot
    close a very tiny race window on x86 which might result in a stale and not
    serviced device interrupt under very unlikely circumstances.
    
    This is explicitly for debugging and testing and not for production use or
    abuse in random driver code.
