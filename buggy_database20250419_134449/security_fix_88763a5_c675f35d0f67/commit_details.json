The intel_powerclamp driver does a\nsimilar action.\n\nInstead of implementing idle injections privately in the cpu_cooling\ndevice, move the idle injection code in a dedicated framework and give\nthe opportunity to other frameworks to make use of it.\n\nThe framework relies on the smpboot kthreads which handles via its\nmain loop the common code for hotplugging and [un]parking.\n\nThis code was previously tested with the cpu cooling device and went\nthrough several iterations. It results now in split code and API\nexported in the header file.
