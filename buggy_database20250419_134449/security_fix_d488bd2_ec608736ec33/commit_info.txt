Full commit message:
Merge tag 'char-misc-5.0-rc4' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/char-misc

Pull char/misc driver fixes from Greg KH:
 "Here are some small char and misc driver fixes to resolve some
  reported issues, as well as a number of binderfs fixups that were
  found after auditing the filesystem code by Al Viro. As binderfs
  hasn't been in a previous release yet, it's good to get these in now
  before the first users show up.

  All of these have been in linux-next for a bit with no reported
  issues"
