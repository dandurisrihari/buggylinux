    arm64: Kconfig: Re-jig CONFIG options for 52-bit VA
    
    Enabling 52-bit VAs for userspace is pretty confusing, since it requires
    you to select "48-bit" virtual addressing in the Kconfig.
    
    Rework the logic so that 52-bit user virtual addressing is advertised in
    the "Virtual address space size" choice, along with some help text to
    describe its interaction with Pointer Authentication. The EXPERT-only
    option to force all user mappings to the 52-bit range is then made
    available immediately below the VA size selection.
