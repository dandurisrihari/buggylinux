Full commit message:
net: fec: replace deprecated strncpy with ethtool_sprintf

`strncpy` is deprecated for use on NUL-terminated destination strings
[1] and as such we should prefer more robust and less ambiguous string
interfaces.

ethtool_sprintf() is designed specifically for get_strings() usage.
Let's replace strncpy in favor of this more robust and easier to
understand interface.

Also, while we're here, let's change memcpy() over to ethtool_sprintf()
for consistency.
