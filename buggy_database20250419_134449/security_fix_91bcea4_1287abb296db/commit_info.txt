fbdev: uvesafb: replace deprecated strncpy with strscpy_pad

strncpy() is deprecated for use on NUL-terminated destination strings
[1] and as such we should prefer more robust and less ambiguous string
interfaces.

We expect v86d_path to be NUL-terminated based on its use with the
C-string format specifier in printf-likes:
|	pr_err("failed to execute %s\n", v86d_path);
and
|	return snprintf(buf, PAGE_SIZE, "%s\n", v86d_path);

Let's also opt to pad v86d_path since it may get used in and around
userspace:
|	return call_usermodehelper(v86d_path, argv, envp, UMH_WAIT_PROC);

Considering the above, strscpy_pad() is the best replacement as it
guarantees both NUL-termination and NUL-padding on the destination
buffer.

Note that this patch relies on the _new_ 2-argument versions of
strscpy() and strscpy_pad() introduced in Commit e6584c3964f2f ("string:
Allow 2-argument strscpy()").
